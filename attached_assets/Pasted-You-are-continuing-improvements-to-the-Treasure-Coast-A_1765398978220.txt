You are continuing improvements to the Treasure Coast AI SaaS in this Replit project.

IMPORTANT:
- Multi-tenant isolation and landing responsiveness are already handled.
- Do NOT change those parts; focus on workspace user management and the New Client wizard.

THIS PROMPT’S GOAL:
1) Make **Create Login / Workspace Users** fully functional and validated.
2) Fix and polish the **New Client / New Workspace** wizard.
3) Allow basic editing of workspace metadata (name/email).

────────────────────
PART A – WORKSPACE USER MANAGEMENT (CREATE / LIST / LOGIN)
────────────────────
Find the UI and backend logic for:
- “Workspace Users” or similar page.
- “Create Login” modal / form.

Tasks:

1. **Validation rules for Create Login**
   - Email:
     - Required.
     - Must be a valid email format.
   - Password:
     - Required.
     - Minimum 8 characters.
     - Should include letters and numbers (realistic for SaaS).

   Behavior:
   - If validation fails:
     - Do NOT hit the API.
     - Show inline error near each field (and/or a toast) explaining what’s wrong.

2. **User creation + listing**
   - A successful Create Login should:
     - Create a user record associated with the current workspace/clientId.
     - Immediately show the new user in the workspace’s user list (trigger a refetch or state update).
   - After a hard refresh, the user should still appear in the list.

3. **User login behavior**
   - Newly created user should be able to:
     - Log in using the client login flow.
     - Land on the correct workspace dashboard.
   - They should NOT see super admin-only routes.

4. **Edit / disable / delete (if UI supports it)**
   - If the UI displays actions to edit or delete a user, implement them:
     - Edit email with the same email validation.
     - Disable/delete:
       - Mark user inactive or soft-delete.
       - Prevent them from logging in if disabled/deleted.
   - If the product is not ready for those actions:
     - Hide or disable those buttons to avoid dead UI.

────────────────────
PART B – NEW CLIENT / NEW WORKSPACE WIZARD
────────────────────
Find the code for the “New Client” wizard launched from the super admin area.

Tasks:

1. **Open reliability**
   - “New Client” button should always open the wizard modal.
   - No silent failures.

2. **Step 1 validation**
   - Required fields (e.g., Business Name, Contact Email) must be validated.
   - Clicking Next with missing/invalid values:
     - Shows inline validation errors.
     - Keeps the modal open.
   - With valid values:
     - Proceeds to Step 2.

3. **Wizard scrolling & layout**
   - Ensure on typical laptop resolution:
     - All fields and the Next/Back buttons are reachable.
   - If the wizard uses nested scroll, simplify if possible:
     - Prefer one scrollable area with sticky footer buttons.

4. **Workspace creation**
   - Completing all steps should:
     - Create a new workspace record in DB.
     - Make it appear in the Clients list immediately (or after a controlled refetch).
   - Optionally, create a default client login or assistant if that is part of your product design.

────────────────────
PART C – EDIT WORKSPACE METADATA
────────────────────
For an existing workspace (especially a QA or non-Faith House workspace):

- Provide a UI to edit:
  - Workspace name.
  - Contact email.
  - Any other primary metadata already displayed.

- Ensure:
  - Changes are validated (email format).
  - Changes are saved to DB.
  - Clients list and workspace overview show updated values after refresh.

────────────────────
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
────────────────────
- ✅ Create Login:
  - Rejects invalid email/password with clear messages.
  - Creates users tied to the correct workspace.
  - New users appear in the workspace user list immediately and after refresh.
- ✅ Newly created workspace users can log in and only see their workspace.
- ✅ New Client wizard:
  - Validates required fields.
  - Does not close silently on error.
  - Successfully creates a new workspace.
  - New workspace appears in clients list without a full app reload.
- ✅ Workspace metadata (name/email) is editable and persists correctly.

Make the necessary frontend + backend changes to achieve this.
