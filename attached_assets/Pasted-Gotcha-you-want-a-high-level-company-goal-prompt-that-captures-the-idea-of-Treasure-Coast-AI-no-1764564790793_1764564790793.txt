Gotcha – you want a high-level “company goal” prompt that captures the idea of Treasure Coast AI, not all the phase-by-phase build details.

Here’s a clean, powerful prompt you can paste into Replit (or anywhere) whenever you need to remind the AI what the business and platform are actually about.

🚀 COMPANY GOAL / PRODUCT VISION PROMPT

You are helping build Treasure Coast AI, an agency-first AI assistant platform.

Read this carefully and treat it as the core vision:
	•	Treasure Coast AI is not a generic “build your own AI app” platform.
	•	It is a system where the agency (me) builds and configures AI assistants for local businesses.
	•	Clients do not build bots. They only log in to see what the bots are doing for them.

Core Goal of the Company

Treasure Coast AI’s mission is:

“Give local businesses a 24/7 AI assistant that captures leads, books appointments, and answers questions – all managed for them by our agency, with a simple dashboard that shows results.”

Product Model (Agency → Client)
	1.	Agency Owner (me)
	•	Logs into an admin panel.
	•	Creates and configures AI assistants for each business:
	•	Business info (services, pricing, hours, location).
	•	AI personality & instructions.
	•	FAQs and common questions.
	•	Website/FAQ scraping to learn the business.
	•	Simple automations (keywords → replies, booking suggestions, etc.).
	•	Generates a small chat widget snippet for that business’s website.
	2.	Client Business (my customers)
	•	Gets a clean, simple client dashboard.
	•	They can only view, not build:
	•	💬 Conversations the bot has handled.
	•	🧲 Leads captured (name, email, phone, what they wanted).
	•	📅 Bookings/appointments generated by the bot.
	•	📊 Simple analytics (how many chats, leads, bookings in last 7/30 days).
	•	They can toggle:
	•	Bot ON/OFF.
	•	Basic notification settings.
	•	Widget color & see their embed code.
	3.	End Users (their website visitors)
	•	See a beautiful chat widget on the business website.
	•	Chat with the AI assistant.
	•	Get answers, leave their info, and/or book appointments.
	•	All of this gets logged as conversations, leads, and bookings in the database and client dashboard.

What the Platform Should Be and Not Be
	•	✅ Should be:
	•	Simple, clean, and stable.
	•	Focused on AI chat + lead capture + bookings + insights.
	•	Optimized for local businesses and agencies.
	•	Easy for me to set up bots for many different clients.
	•	❌ Should NOT be:
	•	A huge “no-code app builder”.
	•	A fully open “build your own AI workflows” marketplace.
	•	A complex Intercom/HubSpot clone with 1,000 features.

Your job whenever you work on this project:
	•	Make design and technical choices that support this agency model.
	•	Always keep the roles clear:
	•	Agency admin builds and manages bots.
	•	Clients only view results and basic settings.
	•	Visitors just chat with the bot.
	•	Prioritize clarity, reliability, and ease of use over complexity.
	•	If you’re unsure about adding something big, ask:
“Does this help the agency build better assistants, or help clients see results more clearly?”
If not, don’t add it.

Use this vision as the north star whenever you’re planning features, writing code, or suggesting improvements for the platform or business.
