Here it is — ONE SINGLE ULTRA-DETAILED MASTER PROMPT that combines:

✔ Everything from the “real widget (corner bubble)” prompt

✔ Everything from the “final polish (demo badge, dashboard link, test ID, etc.)” prompt

✔ Additional clarity + structure so Replit does not misinterpret anything

✔ Explicit instructions, hierarchy, acceptance criteria, QA steps

✔ Written in true “Replit Agent language”

This is the most complete, unambiguous prompt you can give Replit regarding the Faith House Demo Page + Widget + Dashboard Polish.

Just copy/paste exactly as-is into Replit.

🚀 **MASTER REPLIT AGENT PROMPT

Faith House DEMO Page — Final Widget Fix + Full Visual Polish + All Remaining Fixes**

The Faith House DEMO environment is working well (landing page, demo badges, demo dashboard, demo reset, data isolation, etc.).
Now I want to finish ALL remaining work in one combined pass and fix every issue at once.

This task has three major goals:

⸻

✅ GOAL 1 — Replace the oversized assistant panel with a REAL floating chat widget

(Small chat bubble bottom-right → opens floating chat window → close returns to bubble)

The current /demo/faith-house page still shows a large fixed assistant panel on the right.
This MUST be removed.
It looks unrealistic and will confuse clients (“Is it gonna take up half my homepage?”).

🔧 REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. Remove the inline assistant panel
	•	On /demo/faith-house, remove the large assistant card from the hero layout entirely.
	•	The hero area should become clean, text-focused, with NO chat content embedded directly.

2. Mount the REAL chat widget

Use the SAME widget behavior used for embedded client websites:

Closed state:
	•	A discreet circular chat bubble in the bottom-right corner.
	•	Fixed position: bottom-right with margin (e.g., 20–24px).
	•	Use Treasure Coast AI accent color (the same gradient or color used in the page branding).
	•	White chat icon inside.

Open state:
	•	Clicking the bubble opens a floating chat window positioned above the bubble.
	•	The floating window should have:
	•	Dark/translucent glass background
	•	Rounded corners
	•	Subtle border/glow matching TCAI accent colors
	•	Header:
	•	Avatar
	•	“Faith House Assistant”
	•	Subtitle: “Sober Living • Demo”
	•	Small “Powered by Treasure Coast AI” label or logo
	•	Chat body using the SAME widget component used in production.

Close behavior:
	•	Close button in header closes the floating chat window.
	•	Returns to bubble ONLY.
	•	No layout shift.

3. DEMO bot wiring

The widget on /demo/faith-house MUST use:

clientId = faith_house_demo
botId = faith_house_demo_main

This should NEVER use live tenant IDs.

4. DO NOT modify widget behavior on any other routes

Only /demo/faith-house uses this special mounted widget.

⸻

✅ GOAL 2 — Final UI Polish & Structural Fixes (Demo + Admin)

Replit’s last run noted several small inconsistencies.
We fix ALL of them here.

2.1 — Add DEMO badge to workspace detail header (super-admin)

Currently:
	•	DEMO badge shows correctly on workspace cards.
	•	DEMO badge does NOT appear on the workspace detail header after clicking a workspace.

Fix:
	•	When viewing a workspace detail page for any workspace with isDemo = true, show the SAME DEMO badge used elsewhere.
	•	Badge must appear next to the workspace name in the detail header.
	•	Do not show demo labeling on live tenants.

⸻

2.2 — Add a “View Demo Dashboard” link/button inside workspace detail page

The “View Demo Dashboard” link exists only on /demo/faith-house, but not inside the workspace detail page in super-admin.

Fix:
	•	In the workspace detail page for faith_house_demo, add a button:

Label:
Open Demo Dashboard

Behavior:
	•	Opens the client dashboard view for the demo tenant in a new tab.
	•	Use the same client dashboard route used for regular tenants.

Visibility:
	•	Only show if isDemo = true.

⸻

2.3 — Add stable test ID to the chat widget

The automated test could not reliably locate the widget.

Fix:
	•	Add data-testid="faith-house-demo-widget" to the root widget container used on /demo/faith-house.
	•	This must NOT affect styling or component behavior.

⸻

2.4 — Ensure Demo Info Banner & TenantBadge always appear correctly

Fix any inconsistencies:
	•	DemoInfoBanner must appear on demo dashboards.
	•	TenantBadge (“DEMO” vs “LIVE”) must show in:
	•	Sidebar header (already working)
	•	Workspace cards (already working)
	•	Workspace detail header (fix this)

⸻

2.5 — Ensure all DEMO-only elements fully respect isDemo=true

Examples:
	•	Demo reset button
	•	Demo banners
	•	Demo-only text
These must NOT appear on faith_house_live.

⸻

✅ GOAL 3 — QA: Validate No Data Bleed + Widget Behavior + Dashboard Links

Perform this QA after implementing the above.

3.1 — Widget QA
	•	On /demo/faith-house, confirm:
	•	No big assistant panel exists.
	•	Small corner bubble is visible.
	•	Clicking opens the floating chat window.
	•	Booking flows still work (tour / phone_call).
	•	Bookings appear ONLY on faith_house_demo dashboard.

3.2 — Data isolation
	•	Create demo bookings → must ONLY appear in demo dashboard.
	•	Create live bookings (if testing with live widget) → must ONLY appear in live dashboard.
	•	Reset demo data → must NOT touch live data.

3.3 — Workspace UI
	•	Workspace cards: DEMO badge present.
	•	Workspace detail page:
	•	DEMO badge present.
	•	“Open Demo Dashboard” button present IF isDemo=true.

3.4 — Stable test ID

Confirm data-testid="faith-house-demo-widget" is present.

⸻

📄 DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

After implementing everything:

Update replit.md or docs/faith-house-demo-script.md with:
	•	/demo/faith-house now uses floating widget (bubble → chat window).
	•	DEMO badge behavior.
	•	Where to find “Open Demo Dashboard” link.
	•	Widget test ID.
	•	Demo vs Live behavior summary.

⸻

🎯 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (VERY IMPORTANT)

All of the following MUST be true for this task to be considered complete:

✔ The giant right-side chat card is removed from /demo/faith-house.

✔ A small bottom-right chat icon appears instead.

✔ Clicking the icon opens a floating chat window.

✔ DEMO badge appears in workspace detail header.

✔ “Open Demo Dashboard” link exists in workspace detail page for demo tenant.

✔ Widget has data-testid="faith-house-demo-widget".

✔ Booking flow works in demo widget.

✔ QA checks from Section 3 pass.

Once Replit runs this, your demo page → widget → admin views → dashboard → everything will be perfect for pitching.
