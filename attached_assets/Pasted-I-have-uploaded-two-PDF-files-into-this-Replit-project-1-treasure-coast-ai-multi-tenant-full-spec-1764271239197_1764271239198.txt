I have uploaded two PDF files into this Replit project:
	1.	treasure_coast_ai_multi_tenant_full_spec.pdf
	2.	replit_one_shot_prompt.pdf

These two documents contain the full instructions, architecture, bot specs, and requirements for converting this forked project into a multi-tenant AI chatbot platform + demo hub for Treasure Coast AI.

Your tasks:

⸻

1. Read BOTH PDFs completely

Understand:
	•	The full multi-tenant architecture
	•	Required folders and file structure
	•	All routing requirements
	•	Logging behavior
	•	Safety rules
	•	The Faith House bot config
	•	The 5 demo bot configs
	•	The admin panel
	•	Demo selector page
	•	README requirements
	•	Final verification checklist

You MUST follow these two PDFs exactly.

2. Begin the job by doing a full PROJECT ANALYSIS

Before making ANY changes:
	•	Scan every file in this Replit project
	•	Identify the framework (Node/Express or Python/Flask)
	•	Identify the main server entry file
	•	Identify where the chatbot logic currently lives
	•	Identify current routing
	•	Identify how the frontend UI is structured
	•	Identify how the OpenAI API is called
	•	Output a short summary of the current architecture

Do not modify any code yet.
Only output the architecture summary first.

3. After the analysis is done and I approve, begin implementing the conversion

Follow the steps EXACTLY as described in:
	•	treasure_coast_ai_multi_tenant_full_spec.pdf
	•	replit_one_shot_prompt.pdf

In the same order:

A. Restructure the project
	•	Create /bots folder
	•	Create JSON configs for all 6 bots
	•	Create /logs folder
	•	Create /demos, /admin pages
	•	Create multi-tenant routing

B. Implement getBotConfig()

All bot data must load from JSON.

C. Build full multi-tenant chat route

POST /api/chat/:clientId/:botId

D. Build Demo Selector page

GET /demos

E. Build Super-Admin Panel

GET /admin

F. Implement logging

Write logs for each tenant/bot.

G. Enforce global safety rules

Crisis phrases → emergency template reply.

H. Integrate ALL demo bots & Faith House

Using the full config info in the PDF.

I. Update README

Using the documentation structure from the PDF.

J. Final Verification Checklist

Run through the required testing steps.

4. Confirm every milestone with me before proceeding

At each checkpoint:
	•	Show what you built
	•	Show code changes
	•	Ask for approval before moving forward
