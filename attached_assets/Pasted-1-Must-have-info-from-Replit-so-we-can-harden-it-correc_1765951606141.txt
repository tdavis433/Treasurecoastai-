1) Must-have info from Replit (so we can harden it correctly)
A) Where the Recovery House template lives

File path(s) for the Recovery House template config (example: industryTemplates/recoveryHouse.ts or similar)

File path for the Faith House demo config (the object that defines services/FAQs/contact info/etc.)

File path for the bot persona / system prompt used by Recovery House

File path for the Demo page that loads Faith House + the widget

What I need you to paste: the full config object (or at least the keys + sections list) and the bot prompt.

B) Booking + lead logging pipeline (this is the “works perfectly” core)

What are the DB tables involved for:

leads

bookings

booking handoffs (external)

conversations/messages (if stored)

Paste the schema fields (or Drizzle model definitions) for:

leads (fields + required/optional)

bookings

booking_handoffs / handoff table

Paste the API routes that create:

a lead

an internal booking

an external booking handoff / “clicked to book” event

List the status values currently used (exact strings), especially:

internal booking statuses (ex: pending_followup)

external analytics event (ex: clicked_to_book)

any “confirmed” statuses (we must avoid false confirmed)

Show me the current “trust line” copy when external handoff happens:

“You’ll finish on {Provider}…”

Where is that string defined?

C) The routing logic (how the bot decides what to do)

Where is the “intent routing” logic for the Recovery bot?

Is it pure prompt-based, or is there code classification?

Paste the code that decides between:

Answer FAQ vs ask follow-up

Lead capture step

Internal booking request

External handoff redirect

What are the exact triggers for “booking intent” right now?

keywords?

service selection UI?

model tool/function call?

D) The widget flow (front-end)

What component renders the widget for Faith House (file path)?

Does the widget have a multi-step form? If yes, what fields and in what order?

Where is “partial lead save” implemented (if it exists)?

on blur?

on step change?

only on submit?

Is the submit button disabled during request (to prevent duplicates)?

E) Crisis + safety handling (critical for recovery)

Is there any dedicated crisis handler today? If yes, where?

If someone says self-harm/overdose, what happens right now (exactly)?

Does it escalate?

Does it show a disclaimer?

Does it still ask for phone/email?

Do you log a “crisis_flag” event? If yes, where and what data is stored?

2) Nice-to-have info (this is the “make it perfect” layer)
F) The Recovery template content realism

Paste the Recovery House template’s default:

Services/programs list structure

FAQs structure

Contact info structure (phone/email/address/hours)

Any disclaimers block

Are you currently showing:

Insurance accepted list?

Payment/pricing ranges?

Admissions hours vs general hours?

If not, we’ll add “don’t guess” logic + staff follow-up capture.

G) Real demo expectations for Faith House

What is the primary CTA you want for Faith House?

“Request a call”

“Schedule a tour”

“Start intake”

(My recommendation: Request a confidential call)

Do you want the bot to collect:

first name only? (recommended)

full name?

phone mandatory?

email optional?

After-hours behavior:

If it’s 2am, should it say “we’ll call you in the morning” + capture best time?

H) Observability (so you can trust demo results)

Where do leads/bookings appear in:

super-admin dashboard

client dashboard

Paste 1 real example record output (JSON) for:

a saved lead

an internal booking request

an external handoff (if used)

The fastest way to pull this from Replit (do this in 10 minutes)

If you don’t want to hunt manually, run this approach:

In Replit file search, search these keywords and paste the top matches:

recovery

faith

handoff

clicked_to_book

pending_followup

providerName

lead

booking

988

crisis

Paste:

the Recovery template config

the Faith House config

the booking/lead route handlers

the widget component that submits leads/bookings
