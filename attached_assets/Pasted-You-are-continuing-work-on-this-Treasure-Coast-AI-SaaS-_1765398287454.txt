You are continuing work on this Treasure Coast AI SaaS.

IMPORTANT:
- Multi-tenant isolation middleware and storage scoping (effectiveClientId, clientId WHERE clauses) were already audited and documented – DO NOT rewrite them.
- Landing page and general responsiveness have already been improved – leave `home.tsx` alone.

THIS PROMPT’S GOAL:
1) Establish a **single canonical Faith House workspace**.
2) Make sure the Faith House **client dashboard** and **admin workspace view** show the SAME leads, bookings, and conversations.

CREDENTIALS:
- Faith House client user:
  - Username: demo_faith_house
  - Password: demo123

────────────────────
STEP 1 – FIND THE REAL FAITH HOUSE WORKSPACE
────────────────────
In the database/models:
- Locate all workspaces/clients that look like Faith House:
  - Slugs or names like: `faith_house`, `faith_house_demo`, `faith_house_live`, “Faith House (Demo)”, etc.
- Determine which one is actually linked to the user `demo_faith_house`.

Define this as the **canonical Faith House workspace**:
- That is the workspace the client login should use.
- That is the workspace the super-admin should open when selecting Faith House.

If multiple exist, either:
- Migrate necessary data into the canonical one and mark others as deprecated/hidden.
- Or ensure only the canonical one appears as the main Faith House entry in the admin UI.

Add comments in the code where this mapping is clear (e.g., seed data, workspace creation).

────────────────────
STEP 2 – WIRE ADMIN VIEW TO THE CANONICAL WORKSPACE
────────────────────
In the super admin Clients/Workspaces UI:
- The “Faith House” card must open the **canonical** Faith House workspace.

In that workspace’s admin view:
- Overview should display correct counts for:
  - Total leads for that Faith House clientId.
  - Total bookings.
  - Conversations/messages (if tracked).
- Leads tab should list all leads for that clientId.
- Bookings tab should list all bookings for that clientId.
- Conversations tab (if present) should list conversations for that same clientId.

All queries should filter by this canonical workspace’s clientId (using your existing isolation mechanism).

────────────────────
STEP 3 – MATCH CLIENT DASHBOARD DATA WITH ADMIN DATA
────────────────────
For the **same canonical Faith House workspace**:

- Client dashboard (when logged in as `demo_faith_house`) must show:
  - The same total leads / bookings / conversations as the admin Faith House workspace view.
  - Leads table with the same records as admin.
  - Bookings table with the same records as admin.

- Status sync:
  - If admin changes a lead status (e.g., New → Contacted), that status must:
    - Persist in the database.
    - Appear in the client dashboard after page reload.
  - Same for bookings (e.g., Pending → Confirmed).

If necessary, update the client dashboard queries to use the same workspace id and storage methods as admin.

────────────────────
STEP 4 – /demo/faith-house ROUTE
────────────────────
Check how `/demo/faith-house` is wired:

- Ideally, it should use the same assistant/workspace as the canonical Faith House workspace, so:
  - Conversations or leads coming from the public demo can show up in that workspace.
- If you must keep `/demo/faith-house` isolated from “real” data:
  - Document in code comments that it uses a separate demo workspace.
  - Ensure that the client login `demo_faith_house` is NOT attached to that separate workspace.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
────────────────────
- ✅ A single canonical Faith House workspace is clearly identified and used consistently in code.
- ✅ The Faith House client login (`demo_faith_house`) uses this workspace.
- ✅ The super admin “Faith House” workspace view uses this same workspace.
- ✅ Leads, bookings, and conversations match between admin and client for Faith House.
- ✅ Status changes made from admin are visible on the client dashboard and persist after refresh.
- ✅ `/demo/faith-house` either uses this workspace OR is clearly documented as a separate demo workspace.

Implement whatever model, query, or routing changes are needed to achieve this.
