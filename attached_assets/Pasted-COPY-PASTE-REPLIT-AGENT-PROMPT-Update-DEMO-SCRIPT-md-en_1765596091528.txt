COPY/PASTE — REPLIT AGENT PROMPT
Update DEMO_SCRIPT.md + enforce “No Payments” language + add backup 60-second demo + runbook TODOs

GOAL
1) Update DEMO_SCRIPT.md so it’s demo-safe, accurate, and matches platform guardrails:
   - NO PAYMENT PROCESSING (redirect-only booking)
   - “Book Now” redirects externally to the client’s booking/payment provider
   - No “books appointments inline” language unless it truly creates internal appointments without payments
2) Add a 60-second “Safe Demo Path” backup script (if anything gets flaky live).
3) Apply the 5 recommended runbook improvements:
   - remove Stripe mentions entirely
   - add a strong “no --force on prod” gate
   - add a repeatable DB schema verification script
   - add an automated “No Payments” guard test (keyword scan + redirect test)
   - add a short “Safe Demo Path” section at the top of RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md

NON-NEGOTIABLE GUARDRAILS
- NO payment processing ever (no Stripe/Square/PayPal, no checkout UI, no payment intents/tokens).
- Booking must be redirect-only: log booking intent + redirect event → external booking/payment platform.
- Do NOT print or store secrets in docs; passwords may be mentioned only as placeholders (or label as “demo credentials” but do not encourage reuse).

TASKS (DO IN ORDER)

PHASE 1 — UPDATE DEMO_SCRIPT.md (15–20 MINUTE SCRIPT)
1) Replace any wording that implies payments or hosted checkout.
2) Replace “Books appointments inline” with:
   - “Tracks booking intent and redirects externally to the client’s booking/payment platform.”
   - If internal appointments exist, phrase carefully: “Can create an internal appointment request / booking record (no payments), then redirect externally if required.”
3) Add a clear “No Payments” callout inside the Widget Demo section.
4) Add exact “demo questions” and exact click paths for:
   - admin dashboard
   - assistants/bot settings
   - widget preview
   - client dashboard
5) Add a “What to avoid during live demo” section (risky edge cases).

PHASE 2 — ADD A 60-SECOND SAFE DEMO PATH (NEW SECTION)
Add at the top of DEMO_SCRIPT.md:
- 60-second fast demo script (click-by-click + exact 2–3 questions + show dashboards quickly)
- A fallback talk-track if OpenAI rate limits / “high demand” occurs

PHASE 3 — UPDATE RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md (SAFETY + DRIFT PROOF)
Apply these edits:
A) Remove ALL Stripe references
- Remove STRIPE_SECRET_KEY env var
- Remove “Stripe disabled” limitation lines
- Replace with: “Payments are not supported by design.”

B) Add “NO --force on production DB” gate
- State: db:push --force only allowed on disposable dev DBs
- Require backup + rollback plan before any destructive operation

C) Add DB schema verification script
Create: scripts/verify-db-schema.sql
Include checks for:
- client_settings.metadata is jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT {}
- constraint naming alignment entries (list the expected constraint names)
- bot_requests.dedupe_hash constraint existence
Add runbook command:
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f scripts/verify-db-schema.sql

D) Add automated No-Payments guard
Add a CI or npm script that fails if repo contains:
stripe|square|paypal|checkout|payment_intent|client_secret|chargeback|refund|subscription|billing
Also add/ensure an E2E test that asserts:
- “Book Now” redirect target is EXTERNAL (not our domain)

E) Add “Safe Demo Path” at top of runbook
- Short 5-step smoke demo path with exact questions + redirect check

PHASE 4 — OUTPUT (REQUIRED)
1) Commit updated DEMO_SCRIPT.md
2) Commit updated RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md
3) Add scripts/verify-db-schema.sql
4) Add/confirm npm scripts for:
   - guard:no-payments (keyword scan)
   - test:e2e (redirect assertion)
5) Provide a short summary:
   - what changed
   - files touched
   - exact commands to run to verify

## Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions

**Q: How is the AI trained?**
A: "The AI uses GPT-4 with a knowledge base you configure. Website scraping, FAQs, and custom responses."

**Q: Can clients modify their bot?**
A: "Clients have view-only access. Agencies maintain full control over bot configuration."

**Q: What about data security?**
A: "Multi-tenant isolation ensures each client's data is completely separate. HMAC-signed tokens protect widget access."

**Q: How are leads captured?**
A: "The AI detects lead intent and collects contact information inline. Leads are saved automatically with AI quality scoring."

**Q: Can it book appointments?**
A: "Yes! The AI can collect booking information and create appointments directly in the system."
