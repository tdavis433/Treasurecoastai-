Absolutely — here is the fully upgraded version of the Ultimate Replit Prompt, now expanded to include EVERYTHING from my audit, including every missing feature, fix, improvement, structural change, UX correction, backend upgrade, and security requirement I found when analyzing your entire ZIP.

This is now the strongest, most complete, owner-level SaaS rebuilding prompt possible.

Copy + paste the whole thing into Replit exactly as-is.

🚀 THE FINAL, COMPLETE, OWNER-GRADE FULL-SYSTEM REBUILD PROMPT FOR REPLIT

(Paste this into Replit)

You are Replit AI.
You must perform a complete audit, fix, rebuild, refactor, and polish of my entire multi-tenant chatbot SaaS platform.
Follow everything below exactly as written.

⸻

✅ SECTION 1 — GLOBAL RULES (DO NOT IGNORE)

You MUST:

✔ Inspect every file in the entire project

(server/, client/, shared/, public/widget/, bots/, clients/)

✔ Identify EVERYTHING that needs to be:
	•	fixed
	•	added
	•	updated
	•	rewritten
	•	reorganized
	•	secured
	•	optimized
	•	standardized
	•	removed

✔ Implement ALL required changes directly in the codebase.

✔ Preserve all working features (chat, bots, demo bots, leads, analytics, Stripe, admin portal).

✔ Elevate the platform to true production-grade SaaS quality.

✔ No partial upgrades. No TODOs. No skipping. No half-fixes.

⸻

✅ SECTION 2 — AUDIT FINDINGS THAT MUST BE FIXED

Apply ALL the following findings from the audit.

⸻

📌 2.1 Remove JSON as live data sources

Currently the system uses:
	•	/clients/clients.json
	•	/bots/*.json

This creates duplicate truth and WILL break multi-tenant isolation.

You MUST:
	•	Remove JSON as runtime data
	•	Move all client data into Postgres clients table
	•	Move all bot configs into new DB tables:
	•	bots
	•	bot_settings
	•	bot_knowledge (optional JSONB or relational)
	•	Treat JSON files ONLY as templates used when creating a new bot

⸻

📌 2.2 Faith House features bleeding into all clients

Currently:
	•	crisis support
	•	pre-intake flows
	•	red flag logic
appear in general UI.

You MUST:
	•	Add botType or industry column to bots table
	•	Make all sober-living logic template-scoped only
	•	Hide all Faith House flows for non-sober-living bots

⸻

📌 2.3 Control Center too dense

You must:
	•	Split interface into clear sections
	•	Add tooltips
	•	Improve empty states
	•	Add helpful descriptions

⸻

📌 2.4 Missing Bot Creation Wizard

Add a full 5-step wizard:
	1.	Business basics
	2.	Services
	3.	FAQs
	4.	Chat personality
	5.	Install widget

The wizard should generate a bot entry + DB config.

⸻

📌 2.5 Missing Workspace & membership model

Add:
	•	workspaces table
	•	workspace_memberships table

Each business = workspace.
Each owner/team member = membership.

⸻

📌 2.6 Missing API endpoints

You MUST add:
	•	POST /api/bots (create)
	•	PUT /api/bots/:id (update)
	•	DELETE /api/bots/:id
	•	GET /api/bots (list for workspace)
	•	GET /api/chat/history (per bot)
	•	GET /api/admin/logs
	•	POST /api/workspaces
	•	POST /api/workspaces/invite

⸻

📌 2.7 Validation missing on many endpoints

You MUST:
	•	Add Zod validation on EVERY route’s body and query
	•	Reject malformed / unsafe / cross-tenant requests

⸻

📌 2.8 Multi-tenant security must be hardened

All data access must be restricted by:
	•	the authenticated user’s workspace
	•	bot’s workspace
	•	chat session’s workspace
	•	lead’s workspace

Add defensive checks in every service.

⸻

📌 2.9 Automations engine incomplete

You MUST:
	•	Isolate automations V1 into its own module
	•	Add Automations V2:
	•	visual node editor
	•	triggers
	•	conditions
	•	variable storage
	•	message nodes
	•	lead-capture nodes
	•	end nodes
	•	Add backend flow evaluator

⸻

📌 2.10 Widget improvements

You must:
	•	Add bot avatar & bot name to header
	•	Add welcome message
	•	Add theme ability (colors, gradient, fonts)
	•	Add mobile-friendly adjustments
	•	Add protection so botId/clientId in widget cannot be spoofed
	•	Add signed token widget initialization (recommended)
	•	Add rate limiting

⸻

📌 2.11 Analytics improvements

UI must display:
	•	Last 7/30 days
	•	Total conversations
	•	Total leads
	•	Total sessions
	•	Conversion rate
	•	Per-bot analytics

Backend already stores the data — front-end must visualize it properly.

⸻

📌 2.12 Lead management improvements

Add:
	•	status field (new, contacted, closed)
	•	notes field
	•	pagination
	•	search

⸻

	•	tables
	•	buttons
	•	panels
	•	modals
	•	headers
	•	widget

⸻

📌 2.15 Error & loading states missing

Add:
	•	Skeleton loaders
	•	Placeholder cards
	•	Friendly error messages
	•	Retry buttons
	•	Loading animations

⸻

📌 2.16 Remove unnecessary files

Remove:
	•	unused demo pages
	•	old CSS
	•	unused components
	•	unused imports
	•	legacy flow logic

⸻

📌 2.17 Add test coverage

Add integration tests for:
	•	chat
	•	leads
	•	automations
	•	stripe webhooks
	•	admin actions
	•	widget init

⸻

📌 2.18 Billing polish missing

Add:
	•	plan-status card
	•	next billing date
	•	link to Stripe portal
	•	on-hold banner
	•	usage progress bars

⸻

📌 2.19 Super Admin incomplete

Add:
	•	impersonation
	•	plan management
	•	workspace suspension
	•	global analytics
	•	logs viewer

⸻

📌 2.20 Add industry demo bots

Fill DB with templates for:
	•	Restaurant
	•	Barber
	•	Gym
	•	Auto shop
	•	Home services
	•	Tattoo studio
	•	Real estate
	•	Sober living (Faith House)

Use your bot JSON files as seeds.
