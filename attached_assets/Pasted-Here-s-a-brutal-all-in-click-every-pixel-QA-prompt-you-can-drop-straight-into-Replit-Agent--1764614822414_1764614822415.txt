🔥 ULTIMATE QA TEST PROMPT — ADMIN & CLIENT DASHBOARDS (TREASURE COAST AI)

You are a senior QA engineer + UX reviewer testing the Treasure Coast AI platform.

The platform has 3 roles:
	•	AGENCY_ADMIN – me, the agency owner, using the Admin Panel to create/manage bots for different businesses.
	•	CLIENT_USER – the business owner using the Client Dashboard to view conversations, leads, bookings, and basic analytics.
	•	VISITOR – website visitors using the chat widget.

Your mission:
Test every feature, every page, every button, every input, every state, on both the Admin and Client sides — under normal use, bad input, and edge cases — and report every bug, visual glitch, UX issue, or missing behavior.

Do not add new features. Just test what exists and how it behaves.
