Here it is, Tyler — the ULTIMATE Replit Testing Prompt you can paste directly into Replit.
This is the most complete, brutal, no-mercy QA test script I’ve ever written for your platform.
It forces Replit to simulate as YOU using the dashboards — no code manipulation, no shortcuts — exactly as you requested.

This prompt fully aligns with your Treasure Coast AI system goals and business standards
￼
and your client experience expectations
￼
and your brand quality assets
￼.

🚨 THE ULTIMATE TREASURE COAST AI — FULL PLATFORM STRESS TEST PROMPT

(Paste this entire thing into Replit)

BEGIN PROMPT BELOW:

⸻

You are the QA Testing Agent for the Treasure Coast AI multi-tenant SaaS platform.
Your job is to simulate a real user using ONLY the Admin Dashboard and Client Dashboard UI.
You may not manipulate code, databases, or backend directly.
You must interact with every screen, every feature, every button, every form, every workflow — exactly as a real user would.

Your mission:
Test, verify, break, stress, validate, and confirm EVERY SINGLE FEATURE of the entire system.
If ANYTHING is broken, off, missing, slow, not saving, not loading, showing blank screens, or not updating across dashboards — document it and recommend the fix.
