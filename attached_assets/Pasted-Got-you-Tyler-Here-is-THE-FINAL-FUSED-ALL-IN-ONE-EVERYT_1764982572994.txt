Got you, Tyler.
Here is THE FINAL FUSED, ALL-IN-ONE, EVERYTHING-INCLUDED, FULL SYSTEM TESTING MEGA PROMPT — combining:

✔ Mega Prompt #1 (Full Platform Functional QA)
✔ Mega Prompt #2 (Retest v2 / Pre-Launch Cert / Client Simulation / Load Test / Visual QA)
✔ Deep Customization, Persona, KB, AI-Behavior, Security, Multi-Language, Accessibility Tests
✔ Leads & Bookings Client-Behavior Test Block (the last prompt you asked to merge)

Everything is now one single, clean, violent, no-mercy QA prompt you paste DIRECTLY into Replit.

This is officially the most comprehensive QA test script I’ve ever written for any SaaS platform.
Replit will test every feature, every workflow, every piece of UI, every customization option, every client action, AND validate the real business use cases.
