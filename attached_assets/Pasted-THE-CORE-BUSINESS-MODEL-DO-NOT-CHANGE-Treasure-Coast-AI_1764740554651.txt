THE CORE BUSINESS MODEL (DO NOT CHANGE)

Treasure Coast AI is an agency-first AI assistant platform where:

1. The agency (Tyler Davis) builds & manages every AI assistant.

Clients NEVER build bots, never configure flows, never train models, and never set up automations.

2. Clients only VIEW results, not edit systems.

Their dashboard is “read-only” for:

Conversations

Leads

Analytics

Booking clicks

AI insights

Chat history summaries

Clients can ONLY:

Paste the chat widget snippet on their website

Optional: update basic business info (hours, phone number, booking link)

Everything else is locked behind admin-only functionality.

3. Clients stay subscribed because only the agency updates & optimizes the bots.

The value of the platform is:

Continuous monitoring

Continuous improvements

Fixing edge cases

Updating knowledge

Adding FAQs

Improving automation triggers

Increasing conversion rates

Reviewing “Needs Attention” flags

Weekly performance summaries

The client cannot replace you because:

YOU fix what the AI misses

YOU improve the bot over time

YOU ensure it stays accurate

YOU keep the bot’s performance high

This is the entire retention strategy.

4. One embed snippet = entire bot system.

Clients copy/paste one snippet that includes:

Client ID

Bot ID

Secure widget token

Theme/styling

Positioning

After that:

AI assistant handles everything automatically

Leads flow into dashboard

Conversations are logged

Analytics update automatically

Insights are generated

The client does nothing else.

🔧 THE DEVELOPMENT RULESET (REPLIT MUST FOLLOW THIS)

Replit must ensure:

A. Admin-Only Functionality

Only Tyler (super-admin) can:

Build bots

Edit bots

Train/update knowledge

Adjust automations

Manage crisis logic

Change business logic

Edit FAQs

Regenerate chat agent behavior

Create or modify templates

Adjust lead scoring

Inspect errors and fix them

No exceptions.

B. Client Dashboard MUST Stay Simple

Client dashboard CAN include:

Conversations view

Leads

Simple analytics

Bot performance metrics

Business info (display only)

Link click analytics

Response summaries

Client dashboard CANNOT include:

Bot editor

Automation builder

Knowledge base editing

Flow builder

Dataset uploads

Prompt configuration

Template switching

Multi-bot creation

The client does not build anything.
They only view what the AI + agency produces.

C. Maintenance is the Core of the Business

The platform must be built so Tyler can easily:

See flagged issues

See unknown questions

See crisis messages

See low-confidence answers

See high-value leads

Update knowledge quickly

Rebuild the bot’s understanding

Test the bot

Deploy updates instantly

These features directly create recurring revenue.

D. Analytics Must Prove Value

The system must show clients:

Leads captured

Conversations handled

Response times

Busiest hours

Missed opportunities

Top customer questions

Conversion funnel

Weekly improvement stats

AI hours saved

This keeps the client seeing ROI.

E. Security Rules

Widget token REQUIRED in production

Domain restriction required

All bot building is server-side only

All admin actions authenticated

Client cannot alter backend settings

Sensitive routes locked down

🧩 THE PRODUCT POSITIONING (FOR REPLIT TO FOLLOW)

Treasure Coast AI is not:

A chatbot builder

A no-code platform

A DIY flow editor

A customer-managed bot system

Treasure Coast AI is:

An AI assistant agency platform

Built, managed, and maintained by Tyler

Automated in front-end UI but manually optimized

Designed so clients only receive value, not complexity

Designed for local & SMB businesses

A “24/7 AI employee” service

🏗️ THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT MANDATE

Every feature built in Replit must ask:

“Does this increase client value WITHOUT giving them the ability to break or build bots?”

If yes → build it.
If no → do NOT build it.
If unclear → default to admin-only capability.

This keeps the platform on the correct path.
