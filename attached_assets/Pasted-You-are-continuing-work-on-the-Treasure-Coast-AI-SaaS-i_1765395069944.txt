You are continuing work on the Treasure Coast AI SaaS in this Replit project.

Auth, Faith House parity, and user/workspace management should now be improved.

────────────────────
GOAL OF THIS BLOCK
────────────────────
Make assistant configuration usable and robust:

1. Assistant side drawer UX & scrolling.
2. Core tabs (Persona, Hours, FAQs, Knowledge, etc.) save properly.
3. Test Chat UI is stable (ignoring OpenAI rate limits).
4. Widget/embed code is easy to find and copy.

Use a dedicated QA assistant:
- For example: “QA Test Assistant – Deep Config”.
- Create it if it doesn’t exist yet.

────────────────────
STEP 1 – ASSISTANT DRAWER UX & SCROLL
────────────────────
- Ensure assistant detail view (drawer/panel) can scroll naturally:
  - Mouse wheel/trackpad scroll works.
  - No tiny, hidden scrollbars that make content unreachable.
- On common laptop width:
  - All important sections and the Save/Apply button(s) should be reachable.

If there’s nested scrolling:
- Consider simplifying: one scrollable container rather than multiple nested ones.

────────────────────
STEP 2 – TABS & PERSISTENCE
────────────────────
For the QA assistant:

Make sure the following tabs behave correctly:

1. **Overview / Business Profile**
   - Change display name/description to include "QA".
   - Save.
   - Reload the assistant → confirm changes persisted.

2. **Persona / System Prompt**
   - Add a harmless QA marker line in the prompt.
   - Save.
   - Reload → confirm the prompt shows the same text.

3. **Hours**
   - Change at least one day’s hours.
   - Save + reload → confirm persistence.

4. **FAQs**
   - Add a FAQ:
     - Q: “Is this a QA test?”
     - A: “Yes, this is just a QA test.”
   - Save + reload → FAQ still there.

5. **Website Intelligence / Knowledge**
   - If implemented:
     - Add a dummy URL (e.g., https://example.com) or a QA doc.
     - Save + reload → confirm it persists.
   - If NOT implemented:
     - Hide or clearly mark as “coming soon” so it’s not misleading.

6. **Automations / Notifications / Security / Appointments**
   - If active in UI:
     - Make basic toggles/fields save and persist.
   - If not really implemented yet:
     - Hide/disable them or label as “coming soon” to avoid broken UX.

────────────────────
STEP 3 – TEST CHAT
────────────────────
In the assistant’s “Test Chat” tab:

- Ensure:
  - There is a clear text input and send button.
  - Messages show up in the chat area.
  - On send, show a loading state/spinner.
  - If OpenAI is rate-limited:
    - Show a friendly “busy/high demand” message.
    - Do NOT show stack traces or raw error JSON.

We care about **UI robustness**, not perfect AI content.

────────────────────
STEP 4 – WIDGET / EMBED CODE
────────────────────
Make sure there is a clear way to get embed code:

- For this QA assistant, in a “Channels & Widget” or similar tab:

Implement or verify:

- A code snippet that a developer can copy and paste to embed this assistant on their site.
- It should include:
  - `<script>` tag(s) with real assistant/workspace identifiers.
  - Any minimal container markup if needed.
- Provide a “Copy” button to copy the snippet to clipboard.
- No unresolved placeholders like "YOUR_ID_HERE" unless clearly meant to be replaced.

────────────────────
