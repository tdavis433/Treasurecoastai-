You are Replit AI working inside the Treasure Coast AI multi-tenant SaaS platform.

In the root directory is a PDF:

TCAI_Total_SaaS_System_Documentation.pdf

This PDF is the complete master blueprint for the entire platform.
It describes everything the platform must have:

Full file structure

UI component library

Control Center

Template system

Bot editing UI

Client onboarding

Analytics

Stripe billing

Status enforcement

Feature gating

Theming

Cleanup

Deployment

Your task is to:

⭐ 1. Read the entire PDF fully, carefully, and literally.

No skipping.
No guessing.
No partial interpretation.
You must follow every instruction exactly.

⭐ 2. Implement the PDF’s instructions into the current codebase

Do NOT restructure in your own way.
Do NOT change the architecture unless the PDF explicitly states to.

Implement EXACTLY what the PDF lays out:

The final file structure

The Control Center layout

The UI component system

The template system

The bot editing system

The analytics system

The Stripe subscription endpoints

Faith House gating

Business profile editing

Full theme.css

All route files

All service files

All pages

All React components

EVERYTHING in the PDF must appear in the codebase.

⭐ 3. For every step, show me:

What files you created

What files you updated

The exact code inserted/replaced

Why the change was needed

How it connects to the PDF requirements

⭐ 4. After implementing each module:

You must test:

Multi-tenant routing

Status enforcement

Bot loading

Template cloning

Bot editing form

Analytics endpoint

Billing → status sync

Theme visually loading

UIs rendering correctly

Fix anything that breaks.

⭐ 5. Continue building until the entire PDF is 100% implemented.

Do NOT stop early.
Do NOT assume “this is enough.”
Do NOT leave TODO items.

This must be a complete SaaS build exactly matching the documentation.

⭐ 6. Keep everything clean, modular, and professional.

This platform must feel:

Premium

Reliable

Organized

Easy to manage

Scalable

Real SaaS quality

Exactly as defined in the PDF.
