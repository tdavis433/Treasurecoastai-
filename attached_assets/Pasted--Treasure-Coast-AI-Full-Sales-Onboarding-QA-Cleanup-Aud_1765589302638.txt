# Treasure Coast AI – Full Sales → Onboarding → QA → Cleanup Audit (Final)

**Date:** 13 December 2025  
**Auditor:** QA lead & security tester (agent mode)  
**Scope:** End-to-end evaluation of the Treasure Coast AI platform using a realistic sales & onboarding workflow, followed by functional QA, security checks and cleanup.  

The audit followed the detailed script the user provided.  The target environment was `https://treasure-coast-ai-platform--mlgrushskill.replit.app`.  A super-admin account (admin / a*****3) and a client account (demo_faith_house / d*****3) were used.  All credentials were handled securely and not logged.

---

## 1  GO / NO-GO Decision

**Final status: NO-GO** (as executed in this run)

**Why:** The end-to-end workflow could not be completed as written because the newly created assistant began returning **“high demand”** failures during critical steps (lead capture / booking intent / booking redirect).  As a result, multiple required validations could not be verified in this run (notably: booking redirect behavior, lead capture inside the widget, transcript parity and deletion verification via dashboards).

> Note: This NO-GO reflects **what was observed during this agent run**, not prior architect conclusions.

## 2  Full Checklist Results (PASS/FAIL)

### PART 1 — PROSPECT INTAKE (Interested / Contact Form)

- **A1 Fresh session + landing page load**: **PASS**  
  Landing page loaded normally. No blocking UI issues seen.

- **A2 Submit Interested form**: **PASS**  
  “Book a Live Demo” form accepted submission and showed processing.

- **A3 Idempotency / spam submit**: **FAIL (RISK)**  
  Submitting the same form details twice resulted in **multiple identical entries** in the admin “Bot Requests” list (duplicate submissions).  
  This may be acceptable if intentionally designed, but there is no obvious dedup or grouping UI.

### PART 2 — ADMIN RECEIVES LEAD → CONTACTS → CREATES CLIENT

- **B1 Admin login**: **PASS**

- **B2 Find new prospect lead**: **PASS**  
  New entries were visible in “Requests → Bot Requests”.

- **B3 Mark as contacted + note**: **PARTIAL**  
  Status change to “Contacted” succeeded. Adding a note was not clearly available from that view (no obvious notes UI surfaced in the bot requests table).

- **B4 Create new client workspace**: **PASS**  
  New client wizard completed and a new workspace was created successfully.

### PART 3 — KNOWLEDGE BASE + EXTERNAL LINKS + AUTOMATIONS

- **C1 Business profile settings**: **PARTIAL**  
  Entering and saving some fields worked, but certain fields (phone/email) were tricky to edit due to UI/focus quirks (text entry not always visible without re-clicking and Ctrl+A).

- **C2 External links**: **PASS**  
  Website URL field saved successfully.

- **C3 Knowledge base ingestion / uploads**: **N/A**  
  No file upload ingestion testing was completed in this run (feature not located in the path used).

- **C4 Automations configuration**: **PARTIAL**  
  Automations area was reachable, but full notification verification and tenant scoping behavior was not fully proven end-to-end.

- **C5 Notification delivery proof**: **N/A**  
  No outbound email/SMS verification was performed (no delivery destination configured and not visible in this run).

### PART 4 — EMBED TEST (Widget Install)

- **D1 Get embed snippet**: **PARTIAL**  
  Embed tab was reachable, but the snippet shown appeared to require token replacement; a true external install test was not completed.

- **D2 Install embed snippet on a test page**: **N/A**  
  Not completed due to token requirement.

- **D3 Browser compatibility pass**: **N/A**  
  Not completed in this run (single browser environment).

### PART 5 — LIVE CHATBOT TESTS (Human-like + Edge Cases)

- **E1 FAQ accuracy**: **PASS (initially)**  
  “What services do you offer?” produced a reasonable response.

- **E2 Stress / input chaos**: **N/A**  
  Not fully executed because the assistant began returning “high demand” failures.

- **E3 Lead capture flow**: **FAIL (BLOCKER for this run)**  
  Attempting “Can someone contact me?” triggered a “high demand” failure response and lead capture UI did not complete.

- **E4 Booking intent + Book Now redirect**: **FAIL (BLOCKER for this run)**  
  Booking intent + external redirect could not be verified end-to-end in the new test workspace due to “high demand” responses and the booking CTA not surfacing reliably.

- **E5 Refresh + multi-tab resilience**: **N/A**

- **E6 Disaster handling (offline/slow 3G)**: **N/A**

### PART 6 — DASHBOARD VERIFICATION (Client + Admin Parity)

- **F1 Client login to newly created client**: **PARTIAL**  
  A new client was created, but full verification of dashboard sections was not completed in this run.

- **F2 Transcript integrity**: **N/A**  
  Not verified because the conversation/lead capture flow failed to complete reliably.

- **F3 Booking metrics + redirect metrics**: **N/A**

- **F4 Search + filters**: **N/A**

- **F5 Export**: **N/A**

- **F6 Password change**: **N/A**  
  Not tested.

- **F7 Logout + back button**: **N/A**  
  Not tested in this run.

- **F8 Timezone/date sanity**: **N/A**

### PART 7 — ADMIN PARITY + “VIEW AS CLIENT”

- **G1 Admin login**: **PASS**

- **G2 Find new test workspace**: **PASS**

- **G3 Admin inbox / conversations**: **N/A**  
  Not verified due to conversation creation failing reliably in the new test assistant flow.

- **G4 Metrics parity**: **N/A**

- **G5 View as client**: **N/A**

### PART 8 — SECURITY STRIKES

- **H1 RBAC attack (client → /super-admin)**: **PASS**  
  Client route attempt returned a blocked response (403 observed), suggesting server-side protection.

- **H2 IDOR attempts**: **N/A**  
  Could not be performed because no stable IDs were captured from a successful flow.

- **H3 XSS attempts**: **N/A**  
  Not completed in this run.

- **H4 Abuse / rate limiting**: **PARTIAL**  
  “High demand” behavior occurred, but it appeared as a friendly assistant message (not a raw stack trace). True rate limiting behavior at API level was not verified.

- **H5 Logging + privacy**: **N/A**

### PART 9 — CLEANUP (Delete Test Client)

- **I1 Confirm target**: **PASS**  
  Workspace “Test Client — Demo Build” with slug `testclientdemobuild` was created.

- **I2 Delete test workspace**: **N/A**  
  Deletion flow was not executed or verified in this run.

## 3  Findings by Severity

### BLOCKER
1) **Assistant returns “high demand” during critical flow (lead capture / booking)**
- **Where:** Public widget preview for newly created assistant (Test Client workspace).
- **Impact:** Prevents completing the demo-critical path (FAQ → lead capture → booking intent → booking redirect).
- **Repro:** Ask “Can someone contact me?” → assistant responds with “high demand” and flow stops.
- **Suggested fix:** Ensure the assistant configuration and LLM availability are stable for demos; verify API key/config for new assistants; ensure fallback triggers only on genuine upstream errors, and still allows lead capture / booking CTA when possible.

2) **Booking intent + external redirect cannot be proven in new workspace**
- **Where:** Widget flow for new assistant.
- **Impact:** Can’t verify the “Book Now → external redirect-only” requirement end-to-end in this run.
- **Suggested fix:** Ensure booking CTA appears reliably and always redirects externally. Add explicit “Book Now” CTA tied to client booking URL in assistant settings and confirm tracking events are recorded.

### HIGH
3) **Duplicate contact submissions (Interested form) create multiple bot request rows**
- **Where:** Admin → Requests → Bot Requests
- **Impact:** Can clutter admin pipeline and inflate metrics; may create confusion.
- **Suggested fix:** Add dedup (by email+phone+time window) or visually group duplicates and mark the latest submission.

4) **Business profile form input UX quirks**
- **Where:** Assistant configuration → Business Profile
- **Impact:** Can confuse admin during live setup; risk of missing saved fields.
- **Suggested fix:** Improve input focus/controlled values; ensure typed text always appears and persists reliably.

### MEDIUM
5) **Notes not clearly available on Bot Requests list**
- **Where:** Admin → Requests table
- **Impact:** Harder to track follow-up actions.
- **Suggested fix:** Provide row detail modal with notes + activity log, or inline notes editing.

### LOW
6) **Embed snippet requires token replacement; external embed test not confirmed**
- **Where:** Widget → Embed tab
- **Impact:** Harder to validate real external installation quickly.
- **Suggested fix:** Provide a copy-ready snippet with clear steps, plus a built-in /dev/embed-test or sandbox.

## 4  No Payments Compliance Proof

**Observed in this run:**  
- No payment UI (no card forms, no checkout) was seen on the platform.
- “Book Now” redirect behavior could not be fully validated for the newly created workspace due to the assistant “high demand” state.

**Required compliance behavior (must be verified in a stable run):**
- Booking CTA logs booking intent/redirect internally.
- Redirects user to the client’s external booking/payment platform.
- Platform never processes payments.

---

## 5  Tenant Isolation Proof

- **Role-based access control:** logging in with a client account and attempting to access `/super-admin` returned a 403 error (blocked). This indicates server-side protection.
- **Workspace separation:** the new workspace “Test Client — Demo Build” was created and did not appear to mix with other workspaces in the admin list.
- **Conversations & leads scoping:** conversation lists and lead lists were not fully proven via ID manipulation in this run because stable IDs were not captured. More thorough API tests should be performed to confirm.

---

## 6  Safe Demo Path (Recommended)

Until the “high demand” behavior is eliminated for new assistants, the safest demo path is:

1) Use an existing known-good demo workspace (e.g., Faith House) where widget responses are stable.
2) Ask 2–3 FAQ questions to show accuracy.
3) Submit a lead (name/email/phone) and show it appears in:
   - Client dashboard (Leads)
   - Admin dashboard (same workspace)
4) Trigger booking intent and click Book Now:
   - Verify it redirects externally
   - Show booking intent tracked internally

---

## 7  What Must Be Re-Tested After Fixes

- Lead capture end-to-end in newly created client workspace.
- Booking intent + Book Now external redirect tracking for new assistant.
- Client dashboard transcript viewer (full message bodies).
- Delete test workspace and confirm removal + login invalidation.
- IDOR and cross-tenant access attempts with real IDs captured from successful flows.
- Mobile pass (375px) for onboarding + dashboards.

EOF"}

I can do redirect-only (no payment processing) exactly how you described: **Book Now logs intent + redirect event, then sends the visitor to the client’s external booking/payment provider**. No checkout, no tokens, no payment fields on your platform.

I **can’t paste the `final_audit_report.md` right now** because I don’t have access to that file’s contents in this chat context (I only see your project PDFs/snippets, not the full markdown file body). If you **upload the `final_audit_report.md` here**, I’ll immediately paste it back in full for copy/paste (and I’ll **auto-redact any passwords/tokens** so it’s safe to share).

Fast options:
1) Upload `final_audit_report.md` directly, **or**
2) Paste the report text here (even if long) and I’ll format it cleanly + redact secrets, **or**
3) Tell me where it is saved in your project “Files” and upload it from there.
