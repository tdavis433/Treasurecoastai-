TASK: Final Theming Pass for Faith House Demo Widget (Colors, Icon, Greeting, Text)

The Faith House demo environment is functionally complete:
	•	/demo/faith-house landing page uses Treasure Coast AI branding (dark, modern, techy).
	•	Floating chat widget shows as a bubble in the bottom-right and opens a chat window.
	•	Demo vs live tenants are separated and stable.

Now I want a final visual/theming pass specifically for the demo widget and its greeting, so everything looks perfectly integrated with the Treasure Coast AI + Faith House theme.

Think of this as:

“Polish the assistant so it looks like it was intentionally designed for this page, not just dropped in.”

⸻

1. Match the AI Assistant UI to the Demo Page Theme

The /demo/faith-house page already has a dark, premium, Treasure Coast AI style (dark background, neon/glass, blue/teal/purple accents).

Requirements:
	1.	Chat window styling
	•	Ensure the floating chat window (header, body, borders, background) matches the demo page theme:
	•	Dark, glassy background (like other cards on the page).
	•	Subtle gradient or accent border using the same primary accent color(s) as the page.
	•	Consistent typography (same fonts, font sizes, line height).
	•	Bot message bubbles:
	•	Soft, on-brand accent (e.g., muted blue/teal/purple with readable text).
	•	User message bubbles:
	•	Contrasting but complementary color (e.g., neutral dark/light gray that fits the dark theme).
	•	Any icons inside the window (send icon, close icon, etc.) should match the theme:
	•	Proper colors (no random bright primary color that doesn’t belong).
	•	Consistent style (e.g., outline or solid, but consistent with the rest of the UI).
	2.	Header bar
	•	Title text must be updated to:
	•	Faith House Assistant
	•	Subtitle text:
	•	Sober Living • Demo
	•	“Powered by Treasure Coast AI” text or logo:
	•	Use the same color treatment as the rest of Treasure Coast AI branding on this page.
	•	Make sure the avatar and header icons feel polished:
	•	Avatar should fit the Faith House + TCAI vibe (simple, professional, not cartoonish).
	•	Header background and border should match the glass/tech aesthetic of the landing page.

2. Match the Chat Icon (Bubble) to the Theme

Right now we have a working floating widget, but the chat bubble icon and shape need to be visually dialed in to match the page.

Requirements:
	1.	Shape & position
	•	Keep the bubble circular (or a very slightly rounded square if that’s your global style) in the bottom-right corner.
	•	Position: fixed bottom-right with safe margin, same as current behavior.
	2.	Colors
	•	Background color should use the primary Treasure Coast AI accent color used on /demo/faith-house:
	•	If you’re already using a specific gradient or shade (e.g., teal/blue), reuse that here.
	•	Icon (chat bubble symbol) should be:
	•	White or very light, high contrast against the background.
	3.	Hover/focus states
	•	On hover or focus (desktop), apply a subtle glow or scale effect consistent with TCAI’s futuristic/techy feel.
	•	No harsh or off-brand colors.
	4.	Data attribute
	•	Keep data-testid="widget-bubble" intact for the bubble container.

3. Greeting Popup / Welcome Message Styling

If there is a greeting popup or initial welcome message that appears:

Requirements:
	1.	Visual style
	•	Match the greeting popup’s background, border, and shadow to the rest of the widget and landing page:
	•	Dark/glass styling with consistent border-radius.
	•	On-brand accent border or glow, not random default colors.
	•	Text color should be readable on dark background (no low-contrast grays).
	2.	Content & tone
	•	Title / heading for the greeting (if present) should reference:
	•	Faith House Assistant
	•	Text example (you don’t have to hardcode this exact text, this is just a tone guide):
	•	“Hi, I’m the Faith House Assistant. I can answer questions about our sober living home and help you book a tour or schedule a phone call.”
	•	Tone: calm, professional, reassuring. No cartoonish language.
	3.	Iconography
	•	If the greeting uses an icon/avatar:
	•	Keep it consistent with the assistant header avatar (same icon, same style, same colors).

⸻

4. Ensure All Labels & Text Match the Assistant Identity

Throughout the widget on /demo/faith-house:
	•	The assistant should consistently be called:
	•	“Faith House Assistant”
	•	Avoid generic labels like:
	•	“AI Chatbot”, “Support Bot”, “Treasure Coast Assistant” (unless in a “Powered by” context).
	•	The only place “Treasure Coast AI” should appear is:
	•	As the brand powering the assistant (e.g., “Powered by Treasure Coast AI”).
	•	In the page header/branding, not as the assistant’s name.

Check:
	•	Window header
	•	Greeting popup
	•	Tooltip (if any)
	•	Any “assistant name” labels in the UI

Make sure they all say “Faith House Assistant”.

5. Add Small, Tasteful Futuristic Touches (Without Going Overboard)

Add minor refinements to keep the techy, futuristic Treasure Coast AI vibe, for example:
	•	Soft glow around the floating chat window border.
	•	Very subtle animated gradient or shimmer in:
	•	The header line, or
	•	A thin border accent.
	•	Smooth open/close transition for the chat window:
	•	e.g., small scale + opacity animation when opening/closing.

Important:
	•	Keep everything subtle.
	•	No crazy animations that feel like a game.
	•	It should still feel appropriate for a sober living facility (professional, calm) while obviously being modern tech.

6. QA Checklist

After implementing all of the above, confirm:
	1.	/demo/faith-house:
	•	Page background, cards, and the widget all feel like one unified design system.
	•	The chat bubble:
	•	Uses TCAI accent color.
	•	Has a clean, modern icon.
	•	Greeting popup (if used) matches the theme in colors, fonts, and shapes.
	2.	Widget behavior:
	•	Closed state: only the bubble shows.
	•	Open state:
	•	Floating window looks glassy, modern, and premium.
	•	Header shows: “Faith House Assistant” + “Sober Living • Demo” + “Powered by Treasure Coast AI”.
	•	Bot and user message bubbles look on-brand and readable.
	3.	Text consistency:
	•	No mismatched names (“Support Bot”, “Generic Assistant”, etc.).
	•	Everywhere relevant: “Faith House Assistant”.
	4.	Nothing breaks:
	•	Demo vs live separation still works.
	•	Data flow (bookings, conversations) remains unaffected.

Update replit.md or the relevant docs with a brief note that:
	•	The Faith House demo widget and greeting have been fully themed to match the Treasure Coast AI / Faith House landing page.
