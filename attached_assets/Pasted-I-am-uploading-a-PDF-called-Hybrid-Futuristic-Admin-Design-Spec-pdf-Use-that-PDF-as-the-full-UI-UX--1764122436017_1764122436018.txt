I am uploading a PDF called Hybrid_Futuristic_Admin_Design_Spec.pdf.
Use that PDF as the full UI/UX design blueprint for upgrading the entire /admin interface.

Here are the rules you MUST follow exactly:**

🔒 NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (Do NOT break these)

Do NOT change any backend logic, API endpoints, database schema, routes, or functionality.

Do NOT rename or remove existing pages (/admin/dashboard, /admin/appointments, /admin/analytics, /admin/settings).

Do NOT change appointment logic, pre-intake logic, crisis handling, notifications, summaries, analytics calculations, or settings logic.

This is a pure visual redesign — styling, layout, and components only.

🎨 YOUR TASK

Transform the Admin Dashboard UI to match the hybrid design shown in the PDF:

Dark futuristic theme

Glassmorphism cards

Neon blue/cyan accent highlights

Minimalistic sidebar

Transparent blurred top bar

Redesigned stat cards

Clean grid sections

Premium modern layout

📌 WHAT TO CHANGE (Pure UI Only)

You must update the following pages using the PDF specs:

1. /admin/dashboard

Replace KPI cards with the glassmorphism stat cards described.

Add neon accent icons.

Update Top Topics & Recent Leads to match the design.

Apply the new spacing system (24–48px).

Add the transparent, blurred top navigation bar.

2. /admin/appointments

New glassmorphism table card

New search & filter bar

Export button styled to match the theme

Neon status badges

Hover effects

3. Appointment Detail Drawer

Convert to futuristic drawer panel

Frosted side panel

New section styling (Pre-Intake, Summary, Notes)

4. /admin/analytics

Neon-themed chart

Updated KPI mini-cards

Glass panels for categories

5. /admin/settings

Convert settings form into grouped glass cards

Neon toggles

Dark-mode input fields

🛠 COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS

Create reusable components from the PDF spec:

<GlassCard>

<StatCard>

<SidebarItem>

<TopBar>

<NeonBadge>

<DrawerPanel>

Use Tailwind classes and structure EXACTLY as described in the PDF.

📱 RESPONSIVENESS

All components must remain fully responsive and collapse cleanly on mobile.

✔️ DONE WHEN

You are finished only when:

The admin UI visually matches the hybrid design in the PDF

All components convert to the new futuristic/glass style

No functionality has changed or broken

Every page still works exactly the same

If you need more clarification, ask me BEFORE changing any functionality
