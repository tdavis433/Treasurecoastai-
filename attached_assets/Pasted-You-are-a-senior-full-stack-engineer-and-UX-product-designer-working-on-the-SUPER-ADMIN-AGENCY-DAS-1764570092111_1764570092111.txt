You are a senior full-stack engineer and UX/product designer working on the SUPER-ADMIN / AGENCY DASHBOARD of a multi-tenant SaaS platform called **Treasure Coast AI**.

Context:
- Tech stack: Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind (or similar).
- Multi-tenant model:
  - SUPER-ADMIN / AGENCY DASHBOARD → for me (the agency owner).
  - CLIENT DASHBOARD → for each business (simple, read-only-ish).
- Company vision:
  - I create and manage AI assistants for local businesses.
  - Clients only view results and basic safe settings.
  - I need a “god mode” control center where I can create, edit, duplicate, debug, and scale assistants with no real limits.

Your task in THIS prompt:
Perform a full review and improvement pass on the **SUPER-ADMIN / AGENCY DASHBOARD** and upgrade it so it is:
- Powerful and efficient for me as the operator.
- Clean, organized, and fast to use.
- Deep enough to let me build very advanced assistants, templates, and automations.
- 100% aligned with the Treasure Coast AI platform vision.

You must:
1. Review ALL existing super-admin routes, pages, tabs, components, and layouts.
2. Identify anything that should be:
   - Added to give me more control/power.
   - Removed because it’s clutter, redundant, or badly placed.
   - Renamed for clarity.
   - Reorganized into a cleaner flow.
   - Redesigned visually for a better experience.
3. Compare everything against the platform’s goal and then IMPLEMENT the improvements directly in code.

----------------------------------------
PLATFORM GOAL (ADMIN PERSPECTIVE)
----------------------------------------

Treasure Coast AI from my (admin) point of view:

- I should be able to:
  - Manage all clients.
  - Create and configure multiple assistants per client.
  - Adjust any AI behavior, prompts, knowledge, flows, integrations, etc.
  - See global stats (across all clients and assistants).
  - Debug issues quickly.
  - Use templates to spin up new assistants fast.
  - Control billing/plans and usage limits.

- The admin dashboard SHOULD:
  - Feel like a pro “command center” for an agency.
  - Make managing 1 → 10 → 100 clients possible without headaches.
  - Keep all advanced/technical stuff on MY side, not the client side.

- The admin dashboard should NOT:
  - Mix client views with admin views.
  - Hide critical AI/automation settings from me.
  - Force me to dig through raw code to do basic operations.

----------------------------------------
REVIEW SCOPE — SUPER-ADMIN / AGENCY DASHBOARD
----------------------------------------

Audit and improve the super-admin UI around these main areas. If these sections don’t exist yet, create them and/or reshape existing ones into this structure.

### 1) Home / Command Center
- Review the current landing page for the admin.
- Ensure it shows:
  - Total clients
  - Total assistants
  - Conversations over last 7/30 days
  - Leads over last 7/30 days
  - Bookings (if supported)
  - List of top-performing assistants and/or clients
- Add or improve:
  - Clear metrics cards.
  - Simple charts/graphs.
  - “Quick actions” (Create client, Create assistant, Open recent).
- Remove anything noisy or low value.
- Make this page feel like a true “at-a-glance” health view for the whole platform.

### 2) Clients List
- Review the current client management screen.
- Ensure the table includes:
  - Business name
  - Primary contact
  - Email
  - Status (Active / Paused / Trial)
  - Number of assistants
  - Plan
- Verify actions:
  - Open client detail (admin view).
  - Impersonate / “View as client” (open their dashboard as them).
  - Edit client info.
  - Pause/resume client (which affects all their assistants).
- Improve:
  - Filtering and search by name/email/status.
  - Layout, spacing, and labels.
- Remove:
  - Any clutter that doesn’t help manage clients efficiently.

### 3) Client Detail (Admin View)
- For each client, review their detail page.
- Verify there are tabs or sections like:
  - Overview (metrics for this client)
  - Assistants
  - Conversations (optional global view)
  - Leads/Bookings
  - Billing & Plan
  - Users
  - Settings
- Improve:
  - Overview: make sure stats are meaningful (conversations, leads, bookings, etc.).
  - Navigation between tabs: fast and obvious.
- Remove:
  - Technical junk the client doesn’t need to know (logs, raw JSON, etc.) from this view.
  - Anything that should live in a deeper “System Logs” section instead.

### 4) Assistants / Bots (Global)
- Review the global assistants list.
- Ensure the list has:
  - Assistant name
  - Client name
  - Status (Active / Paused / Demo)
  - Type (website widget, SMS, etc. if available)
  - Key metrics (conversations, leads)
- Add / improve:
  - Filters by client, status, type.
  - Quick actions: open in editor, duplicate, pause/activate.
- Clean up:
  - Any confusing columns.
  - Inconsistent naming between different pages.

### 5) Assistant Editor (God Mode)
- This is the heart of your power. Review all assistant-editing pages/components.
- Make sure the editor supports at least these sections:

  [Overview]
  - Shows client, channels, status, basic stats.

  [Persona & System Prompt]
  - Assistant name, description.
  - Persona settings (tone, style).
  - System prompt / core instructions in a large, well-labeled editor.
  - Any helper UI that makes editing prompts safer and clearer.

  [Knowledge / Content]
  - Ability to attach:
    - FAQ sets
    - Scraped website content
    - Documents (if supported)
  - Clear indicators if knowledge is in sync or needs reindexing.

  [Automations / Flows]
  - Trigger → Action rules (keywords/intents → actions).
  - Data structure (e.g. JSON stored in DB).
  - Make the UI structured and easy to scan/edit.

  [Channels & Embeds]
  - Enable/disable website widget, SMS, etc.
  - Provide embed snippet for the widget.
  - Basic channel-specific options.

  [Testing / Sandbox]
  - A built-in test chat panel:
    - Send test messages using current settings.
    - Optionally view raw request/response (for admin debugging).

  [Advanced AI Settings]
  - Model selection, temperature, max tokens, safety behavior, etc.
  - Only visible in the admin dashboard.
  - Organized and clearly labeled (no random input fields).

- Improve:
  - Group related settings.
  - Consistent input styling.
  - Clear “Save” and “Revert” controls.
- Remove:
  - Dead/experimental fields.
  - Any duplication across tabs.

### 6) Templates / Playbooks
- Review current templates (if any).
- Ensure:
  - There’s a clear templates section for common niches (sober living, barber, gym, etc.).
  - Each template includes default persona, prompts, FAQs, automations.
- Improve:
  - Template list UI.
  - Flow: “Create client from template” and/or “Create assistant for client from template.”
- Remove:
  - Half-broken template code or unused sample data.

### 7) Knowledge Management (Global)
- If there’s a global knowledge view, make sure it’s useful:
  - Filter by client and assistant.
  - Show counts of FAQ entries, docs, sources.
- Improve:
  - Any bulk actions (reindex, remove stale source).
- Remove:
  - Confusing or redundant views that don’t add clear value.

### 8) Integrations & API Keys
- Review the integrations/settings pages.
- Ensure:
  - There’s a clear place for OpenAI/LLM provider keys.
  - Other integrations (email, SMS, Stripe, etc.) are grouped here.
- Improve:
  - Form layout, error states, and status badges (Connected / Not Configured / Error).
- Ensure:
  - Keys are never shown on client side.
- Remove:
  - Any unused integration stubs without at least a clear TODO.

### 9) Billing & Plans (Admin)
- Review the billing admin screens (if any).
- Make sure you can:
  - Define plans (name, price, limits).
  - Assign plans to clients.
  - See plan status per client.
- Improve:
  - UI clarity around limits and current usage (if available).
- Add TODO comments if deeper Stripe integration is needed later.

### 10) Users & Roles
- Review user management in the admin.
- Confirm:
  - User model supports roles (SUPER_ADMIN, AGENCY_USER, CLIENT_OWNER, CLIENT_USER).
  - You can invite, edit, disable users.
- Improve:
  - Role labels and descriptions.
  - Layout of user lists.
- Remove:
  - Any legacy role logic that conflicts with the multi-tenant model.

### 11) System Health & Logs
- Review any existing logs/error screens.
- Improve:
  - Make it easy to see which clients/assistants are having issues.
- Ensure:
  - This page is admin-only.
- Remove:
  - Raw, unreadable dumps; instead show organized tables.

----------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
----------------------------------------

After reviewing the whole admin dashboard:

1. **List improvements** (mentally/inline) and then implement them in code:
   - Add missing pages/sections where needed.
   - Restructure navigation to match the layout above (or close to it).
   - Clean up labels, copy, and button text.
   - Fix layouts that feel cramped or inconsistent.

2. **Refactor for clarity and maintainability**:
   - Extract reusable components (cards, tables, forms).
   - Remove dead code and unused imports/components.
   - Keep TypeScript types accurate and strict.

3. **Respect multi-tenant security**:
   - Super-admin can see everything.
   - Client users can see only their tenant’s data (this is enforced in APIs and queries).
   - No cross-tenant data leaks.

4. **Do an end-to-end admin UX pass**:
   - Simulate being me (agency owner) and:
     - Add a client.
     - Create an assistant from a template.
     - Configure its persona, knowledge, automations.
     - Grab the widget snippet.
     - Check stats in the command center.
     - Impersonate the client.
   - Fix any friction you encounter.

----------------------------------------
CONSTRAINTS
----------------------------------------
- Do NOT break or weaken tenant isolation.
- Do NOT expose API keys or internal secrets in client views.
- Keep the client dashboard separate and simpler; this prompt is ONLY for the super-admin side.
- Use existing design system and components where possible.
- Keep everything production-ready, clean, and well-organized.

----------------------------------------
GOAL
----------------------------------------
Deliver a **super-admin / agency dashboard** that:
- Feels like a powerful “god mode” control center.
- Makes it easy to manage many clients and assistants.
- Gives me deep control over AI behavior, knowledge, and automations.
- Stays aligned with the Treasure Coast AI platform vision at all times.
