The clean move is: convert Faith House to DemoPageTemplate for section parity + consistency, and add a “Faith House variant” hook so you retain the particle/ambient hero and premium vibe.

That aligns with the platform north-star: fast value, trustworthy, no broken states. 

Treasure_Coast_AI_Platform_Goal…

Step-by-step (high level)

Inventory the config sections Faith House already has (Services, Team, Testimonials, Niche Stats, FAQ, Contact Info).

Upgrade DemoPageTemplate to support overrides:

heroVariant or HeroOverride

optional BackgroundFX slot (particle canvas, ambient glow)

keep the rest standardized (services/team/testimonials/faq/contact).

Swap /demo/faith-house to use the template, passing the Faith House config + the visual overrides.

Regression test the demo against your demo acceptance checklist (widget + lead capture + booking + dashboards). 

Treasure_Coast_AI_Platform_Goal…

Alternatives (when they make sense)
Option A (keep custom, add missing sections)

Good if you’re rushing for a single demo today, but you’ll be babysitting a bespoke page forever. It also increases the chance the demo drifts from the config again.

Option C (keep as-is)

Only valid if Faith House is purely a “platform feature landing page” and you don’t care if it looks like a real business site. That’s risky for trust.

Practical action plan (what to tell Replit)

Here’s a copy/paste Replit prompt that executes the hybrid “Option B but keep the visuals” approach:

REPLIT PROMPT (PASTE THIS):

You are a senior full-stack engineer working on the Treasure Coast AI demo system.

Goal:
Convert /demo/faith-house from a one-off custom page into the reusable DemoPageTemplate, while preserving the Faith House premium visual identity (particle effects / ambient background / gradient hero). Faith House must display ALL sections that exist in its config, matching the other demos.

Requirements:

Faith House demo must use DemoPageTemplate so it automatically renders:

Services

Team Members

Testimonials

Niche Stats

FAQ

Full Contact Info (phone/email/address/hours)

(Plus any existing template sections already used by other demos)

Preserve the Faith House custom “wow”:

Add a variant or override mechanism to DemoPageTemplate:

heroVariant="faith-house" OR HeroOverride component prop

Optional BackgroundFX slot that can render the current particle/ambient background

Faith House should look the same (or better) visually after migration.

No regressions:

Chat widget must still load and function on /demo/faith-house

Lead capture + booking flows still work

No layout overflow, no dead sections, no missing content

Demo readiness checks (must pass):

Faith House demo page: widget loads, answers FAQs, captures contact info, creates booking

Lead shows up in BOTH admin and client dashboards with correct fields/timestamps

Booking shows up with type/time in dashboards

Rate-limit/errors show as friendly in-chat messages (never scary red toasts)

Deliverables:

PR-quality refactor with clean props and minimal duplication

Faith House config is the single source of truth for its content sections
