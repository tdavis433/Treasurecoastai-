You are a senior full-stack engineer working inside this Replit project for the Treasure Coast AI SaaS.

Context:
- We’ve already fixed and verified:
  - Multi-tenant isolation by client_id.
  - New client wizard.
  - Auto-assistant creation for new workspaces.
  - Widget design persistence (color, position, greeting).
  - Lead/booking creation via Test Chat.
  - Assistant configuration drawer + embed snippet.
  - Client/admin dashboards for Faith House and QA workspaces in previous passes.

From the most recent QA agent regression run, we have:

1) One likely real UX bug:
   - BUG-REG-001: In the **admin** “Leads” tab for a workspace, the lead rows are not clickable, so the lead detail modal/drawer never opens. This blocks seeing tags and activity logs from the admin UI.

2) Several things that are probably fine but were only “PARTIAL / NOT TESTED” from the agent’s perspective:
   - Client conversation transcript view.
   - /dev/embed-test dev embed page.
   - Password reset UX (requires console reset URL).
   - Admin vs client parity after new leads/bookings.
   - Multi-tenant isolation sanity checks for QA vs Faith House.

Please do the following.

────────────────────────
1. FIX BUG-REG-001 (ADMIN LEADS ROW CLICK)
────────────────────────

Goal: In the **super-admin → workspace → Leads** view, each lead row should be clickable and open a lead detail view that shows tags and the activity log.

Requirements:

- In the admin “Leads” table (for a specific workspace):
  - Make the entire row (or at least the lead name cell) clickable.
  - On click, open the existing lead detail drawer/modal that:
    - Shows full lead details (name, email, phone, created date, status).
    - Shows the tags section (e.g., purple tag badges).
    - Shows the Activity section (capture event + status changes).
  - Apply UX polish:
    - Row hover state (e.g., subtle background change).
    - `cursor: pointer` so it’s obviously clickable.

- Do NOT change the underlying lead data model or automation logic.
  - Tags and activity logs are already being written by automations; this is purely a UI/interaction issue.

- Acceptance criteria:
  1) As super-admin, open any workspace → Leads.
  2) Click a lead row.
  3) A detail view opens, showing:
     - Lead fields.
     - Tags badges (if present).
     - Activity timeline.
  4) Close the detail view and repeat for another lead.

2. VERIFY CLIENT CONVERSATION TRANSCRIPT VIEW
────────────────────────

Goal: Ensure clients can actually open and read full transcripts, not just a snippet.

- As a **client user** for a QA workspace:
  - Sign in as a known client user (e.g., an existing QA client or demo_faith_house).
  - Go to Conversations / Inbox.
  - Click a conversation row.

- Confirm:
  - Full transcript is visible, not just a one-line summary.
  - Collapsible / expandable history works (if implemented).
  - No weird overflow or cut-off text.

Only change code if:
  - Clicking a conversation row does nothing.
  - Transcript renders incorrectly.

If changes are needed, keep them minimal and scoped to:
  - Making the conversation list item clickable.
  - Opening an existing transcript component / drawer / modal.

────────────────────────
3. VERIFY /DEV/EMBED-TEST PAGE
────────────────────────

Goal: Ensure the dev embed test tooling is actually usable for us when integrating with client websites.

- As super-admin:
  - Navigate to `/dev/embed-test`.
  - Use the UI to:
    - Select a workspace (e.g., a QA workspace).
    - Select an assistant for that workspace.

- Confirm:
  - The generated embed snippet includes BOTH:
    - A workspace identifier (e.g., `data-client-id`).
    - A bot identifier (e.g., `data-bot-id`).
  - The copy-to-clipboard button works (no error toast).
  - The live iframe preview:
    - Loads the widget.
    - Respects the assistant’s widget settings (color + position + greeting), as much as possible.

If the iframe preview fails due to CSP or environment constraints:
  - DO NOT hack around with insecure settings.
  - Just make sure:
    - The snippet is correct.
    - Any error state in the preview is shown cleanly.
  - Document limitations in `replit.md`.

────────────────────────
4. PASSWORD RESET UX – DEV CHECK
────────────────────────

Goal: Make sure the implemented password reset flow is sound, even if email is dev-only.

- Use an existing QA user (e.g., a QA client account) and:
  - Go to the login page → click “Forgot password?”
  - Request a reset for that user’s email.

- In **development**:
  - Confirm the reset link is logged to the server console as intended.
  - Use that reset URL:
    - Set a new password.
    - Verify:
      - Old password no longer works.
      - New password works.
      - The token is single-use (reusing the URL fails gracefully).

If needed:
  - Improve the dev error/confirmation messages on the frontend, but do not expose whether a given email exists (avoid email enumeration).
  - Ensure this behavior is clearly documented in `replit.md` (how to test in dev, what env vars needed in prod).

────────────────────────
5. ADMIN VS CLIENT PARITY & MULTI-TENANT SANITY CHECK
────────────────────────

Goal: Double-check “real world” parity and isolation around leads/bookings.

- Create or use an existing QA workspace and assistant.
- Via Test Chat:
  - Create at least one new lead and one booking (e.g., “QA Regression Visitor”).

- As client:
  - Note leads & bookings count and key details (name, status).

- As super-admin:
  - Open the same workspace:
    - Confirm counts match.
    - Confirm the same lead & booking appear with identical details.

- Multi-tenant check:
  - Ensure that this QA lead/booking does NOT show up in the Faith House workspace in admin view.
  - Log in as `demo_faith_house` and confirm the QA data does not appear in Faith House client view.

If you find any discrepancies (e.g., lead count mismatch, cross-tenant leakage), fix the underlying scoping or aggregation logic, keeping the existing `client_id` scoping pattern intact.

────────────────────────
6. DOCUMENTATION UPDATE
────────────────────────

After implementing the above:

- Update `replit.md` with a short appendix:
  - “Admin Lead Detail UX”
    - Explain that admin can click a lead row to open the detail view (tags + activity).
  - “How to test /dev/embed-test”
  - “How to test password reset in dev (console-only link)”
  - “Admin/client parity & multi-tenant QA checklist” (bullet points of what we just asked you to do).

Please keep changes tight and focused:
- Do NOT modify Faith House core seed data or credentials.
- Do NOT change working flows unless you find a clear bug.
- Favor small, well-structured components and clear event handlers for row clicks and modals.

When you’re done, the app should be ready for real small-business demos:
- New client onboarding flow works end-to-end.
- Assistant can capture leads & bookings.
- Admin and client can both inspect those leads.
- Dashboards are in sync.
- Widget is ready to embed with a tested snippet.
