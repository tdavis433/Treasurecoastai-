You are building a simple but powerful AI assistant platform for small businesses.

Your job is to build a clean system with:

⸻

⭐ 1. ADMIN PANEL (for me only)

This must include:

Bot Builder (Simple)
	•	Business name
	•	AI instructions

	•	Services offered
	•	Pricing info
	•	Business hours
	•	Location

	•	Primary color
	•	Accent color

Automations (Simple)
	•	Trigger: Keyword
	•	Trigger: Intent
	•	Action: Send message
	•	Action: Send link
	•	Action: Notify admin
	•	Action: Tag lead

Preview Mode
	•	Test messages
	•	See bot replies
	•	Adjust settings

⸻

⭐ 2. CLIENT DASHBOARD (Simple + Clean)

Clients should ONLY see:

Chats
	•	List of conversations
	•	Messages
	•	Lead contact info
	•	AI summary
	•	Mark as resolved

	•	Customer details
	•	Linked chat
	•	Calendar integration

Settings
	•	Toggle bot on/off
	•	Notification settings
	•	Widget color
	•	Embed snippet

⸻

⭐ 3. WIDGET (Simple + Nice)
	•	Chat bubble
	•	Welcome message
	•	Lead capture
	•	AI replies
	•	Booking support
	•	File upload optional (MVP not required)

⸻

⭐ 4. AI ENGINE (Simple + Reliable)

Use these features:
	•	Instructions from admin panel
	•	FAQs from admin panel
	•	Business info
	•	Lookup business hours
	•	Lookup services
	•	Lookup prices
	•	Lookup booking link
	•	AI memory limited to the conversation only
	•	No complicated workflows

Just high-quality, structured responses.

⸻

⭐ 5. TECH STACK

Use:
	•	Next.js
	•	TypeScript
	•	React
	•	Tailwind
	•	Prisma (Postgres)
	•	OpenAI gpt-4o-mini or better
	•	Shadcn UI
	•	Simple REST API
	•	Socket or Pusher for realtime chat

⸻

⭐ 6. REQUIREMENTS

The platform should:
	•	Compile with zero errors
	•	Be visually clean
	•	Be easy to navigate
	•	Be stable
	•	Be simple
	•	Focus ONLY on chat, leads, booking, and simple bot setup

Do NOT build:
	•	Enterprise-level systems
	•	Workflow monsters
	•	Multi-channel messaging
	•	Bot-builder-with-code
	•	A whole mini-Zendesk
	•	Marketplace
	•	50 features I don’t need

JUST build the essentials above.

⸻

⭐ 7. FINAL TASK

When done:
	•	Test every page
	•	Test every form
	•	Test bot logic
	•	Test widget
	•	Test chat flow
	•	Fix ALL issues automatically

Then provide:
	•	A bug list
	•	A recommendations list
	•	A summary of what’s built

⸻

⭐ END OF PROMPT

Build ONLY what is listed above. Nothing more.
