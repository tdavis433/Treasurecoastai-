You already identified these tasks:

- Understand how bookings are made
- Sync bookings between client and admin
- Fix errors in adding clients
- Fix assistant wizard modal scrolling
- Fix booking type and date storage
- Add buttons to sign out
- Check all fixes are working

Now implement them with these concrete acceptance criteria:

1) Booking pipeline + data sync
- Ensure leads and bookings created by the Faith House demo chat:
  - Are saved with the correct client/workspace id.
  - Appear in BOTH:
    - Faith House client dashboard (Leads, Bookings, Conversations).
    - Super admin → Faith House workspace views.
- Ensure both booking types (tour + phone call) are stored and rendered.
- Store real datetime values based on user input, and show those exact times in the UI.

2) Add Client wizard
- Fix the backend API so submitting the Add Client wizard:
  - Creates a new workspace with the supplied data.
  - Returns success, not a 500.
- Frontend: show a friendly error on failure, not raw JSON.
- On success: new workspace appears in Clients list without redirecting to the public landing page.

3) Assistant creation wizard
- Make the wizard’s content area scrollable with a fixed footer for Next/Back/Finish buttons.
- Ensure validation works and the wizard can be fully completed.
- Creating a “QA Test Bot” for a test workspace should succeed and show in the Assistants list, and be deletable.

4) Workspace Users tab
- Fix the create-user API and frontend so that:
  - After creating a client user, the Users list refreshes and shows the new user.
  - Errors show a clear, human-readable message.

5) View as Client
- Implement a working “View as Client” for Faith House:
  - Clicking it should navigate the super admin to the Faith House client dashboard (no about:blank, no 404), using existing auth and tenant scoping.
  - If proper impersonation is not ready, remove or disable the button instead of leaving it broken.

6) Logout buttons
- Add visible Logout controls to the admin and client dashboard layouts.
- Wire them to the existing logout route so the user is redirected to login/public and cannot access dashboards without logging in again.

7) Post-fix verification
- After changes, re-run the following manual scenarios and ensure they pass:
  - Faith House E2E: chat → lead + tour + phone call → both dashboards show correct data.
  - Add Client: create and delete a QA test workspace successfully.
  - Assistant wizard: create and delete a QA test bot.
  - Users tab: create a test user and see them listed.
  - View as Client: works or is safely removed.
  - Logout: visible and functional in both admin and client dashboards.

Make the minimum code changes necessary to satisfy all of the above, then output a short summary of which files you touched and how each acceptance criterion is now satisfied.
