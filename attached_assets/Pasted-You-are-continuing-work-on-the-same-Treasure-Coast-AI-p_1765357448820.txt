You are continuing work on the same Treasure Coast AI platform.

Assume:
  • Core lead/booking pipeline is now resilient.
  • Multi-tenant isolation and admin flows are working.

Goal of this phase:
  Make the user-facing experience (chat + dashboards + assistant builder + navigation) simple, obvious, and clean.

Do NOT:
  • Break any working flows from Phase 1.
  • Rebrand or radically redesign – keep the dark neon look.

────────────────────────
TASK GROUP 1 – CHAT WIDGET UX & ERROR RECOVERY
────────────────────────

1) Send vs Reset clarity:
   - Public and demo chat widgets must:
       • Have a single, obvious “Send” action:
           – Enter key sends.
           – A clear paper-plane icon sends.
       • Move “Reset” / “Restart” away from the send icon.
           – Put it in the header as “Reset chat” or in a menu.
           – Use a clear label or tooltip.
   - Remove any confusing duplicate arrows that cause accidental resets.

2) Conversation reset on demo:
   - On /demo/faith-house (and any other demo routes):
       • Add a clearly labeled “Reset Chat” control (↻ Reset).
       • Clicking it should:
           – Clear visible conversation history.
           – Reset local state/session for that widget.
       • This reset must NOT delete already-saved leads/bookings in the DB.

3) Error recovery:
   - When OpenAI returns a “high demand” / error:
       • Show a friendly message and allow user to continue after a short timeout.
       • Optionally show hint: “Please wait a moment, then ask again.”
       • Ensure the input is re-enabled.
   - Conversation should not become permanently dead due to one error.

4) Scroll behavior:
   - Make the chat conversation area a single, intuitive scroll area.
   - Ensure:
       • New messages auto-scroll into view.
       • There’s no confusing double-scroll (outer vs inner) if possible.

────────────────────────
TASK GROUP 2 – BOOKINGS, LEADS, AND CONVERSATIONS UX
────────────────────────

1) Booking details:
   - Confirm that both Tour and Phone Call bookings:
       • Are created with correct type.
       • Show a precise datetime OR a clear “preferred time” description consistent with what user requested.
   - Fix any mismatch where a specific time becomes vague (“tomorrow afternoon”).
       • Store both a machine datetime and human-readable text if needed.

2) Admin Conversations cleanup:
   - In admin Conversations list:
       • Hide or filter out entries with 0 messages (“Anonymous Visitor – 0 msgs”).
       • For real conversations:
           – Show a meaningful snippet (e.g. first user message or intent).
           – Make rows clickable to open the full transcript (like client view).

3) List scroll & refresh:
   - Leads/Bookings lists (admin and client):
       • Avoid non-obvious internal scroll containers where possible.
       • Prefer full-page scroll, or clearly show a scrollbar inside the card.
   - Ensure lists refresh reliably when new data comes in (no stale UI).

────────────────────────
TASK GROUP 3 – USER MANAGEMENT UX
────────────────────────

1) Create Login UX:
   - After creating a user:
       • Immediately show the new user row in the table.
       • Show a success toast (“Login created for …”).
   - On failure:
       • Show inline field errors (invalid email, password too short, duplicate email).
       • Never show raw JSON.

2) Basic management (if feasible without big changes):
   - Add minimal controls such as:
       • Ability to deactivate a user or trigger a password reset.
   - If full reset flow is too heavy for now:
       • At least plan for it and make sure UI doesn’t promise something that isn’t implemented.

────────────────────────
TASK GROUP 4 – SETTINGS & ASSISTANT BUILDER UX
────────────────────────

1) Hide or finish incomplete settings:
   - Audit Settings areas:
       • Workspace “Edit” forms that only show “Coming soon”.
       • Integration toggles that don’t actually do anything.
   - For anything not wired up:
       • Hide it, disable it, or clearly label as “Coming soon” so users are not misled.

2) Assistant builder & wizard:
   - Ensure Create Assistant wizard:
       • Is fully scrollable on laptop screens.
       • Has visible Next/Submit buttons on all steps.
   - In existing assistant tabs (Business Profile, Hours, FAQs, Widget Design, etc.):
       • Ensure long content (e.g. many FAQs, long forms) is scrollable.
       • Avoid fields getting cut off (especially on Widget Design).
   - Test Chat tab:
       • Should load latest assistant config.
       • Provide a way to reset context if needed so admins can test from a clean slate.

────────────────────────
TASK GROUP 5 – NAVIGATION & LAYOUT POLISH
────────────────────────

1) Top navigation overflow:
   - On pages where the top nav (Dashboard, Clients, Assistants, etc.) overflows:
       • Implement responsive behavior:
           – Wrap items to second line OR
           – Collapse extras into a menu at narrower widths.
       • Avoid horizontal scrollbars for nav.

2) Modals & scroll:
   - Ensure all modals/popups:
       • Show a clear internal scrollbar when content exceeds viewport.
       • Do not trap the user in a weird double-scroll situation.

3) Maintain layout consistency:
   - As you tweak UI, preserve:
       • Dark neon aesthetic.
       • Consistent card spacing, headings, table alignment.
   - No new text overflow or alignment issues should be introduced.

────────────────────────
DELIVERABLE FOR THIS PHASE
────────────────────────

When done, summarize:

  • Changes to:
       – Chat UX (send/reset, error handling, scroll).
       – Bookings/leads/conversations UX.
       – User management UX.
       – Settings and assistant builder.
       – Navigation/layout.
  • Files you touched.
  • Manual checks you ran:
       – Faith House demo chat behavior.
       – Dashboards (client + admin) lists and filters.
       – Create Login and user appearance.
       – Assistant creation and editing.
       – Navigation at normal + smaller widths.
