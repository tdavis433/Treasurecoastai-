You are a senior UI/UX + full-stack engineer. We are refining the Faith House / Sober Living chat widget experience.

GOAL

For business.type === "sober_living" (Recovery / Faith House demos), remove all unnecessary on-widget “options” UI (the selectable program/service cards like “Outpatient Coordination / Employment Support / Alumni Program”). We want a simple chat: user types questions, AI answers. The services/programs must remain in config for AI context but should NOT be presented as clickable options.

CURRENT ISSUE (WHAT TO REMOVE)

In the Faith House widget, above the message input, there are stacked selectable cards/options listing programs/services (see screenshot). We do NOT want these displayed for sober living.

REQUIRED BEHAVIOR

For business.type === "sober_living":

Do NOT render any “service options”, “program cards”, “quick replies”, “suggested services”, or “select a service” UI blocks in the widget.

The message input should be the primary interaction.

Keep “Talk to a person” (human handoff) available.

Do NOT delete services/programs from the config object. AI still needs them to answer questions accurately.

Do NOT break:

deterministic Recovery Router

internal admissions flow (appointments)

session-based lead upsert

crisis handling

No empty space:

After removing the options block, tighten spacing so the chat input sits naturally under the last assistant message.

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

A) Identify where the widget renders the program/service option cards.

Likely files:

client/src/components/ChatWidget.tsx

client/src/hooks/useChatAssistant.ts

client/src/components/demo/DemoPageTemplate.tsx
Search for render blocks tied to:

config.services

“suggested”

“quick replies”

“options”

“service cards”

“Select a service”

mapping over services to render UI cards

B) Add a sober living guard (simple + robust):

Determine isSoberLiving = config?.business?.type === "sober_living"

Wrap the entire options/cards UI block with:

if (!isSoberLiving) { render options }

Ensure all downstream code that expects a selected service is null-safe (no crashes).

C) Optional but recommended (for future control):

Add a config flag with a safe default:

widget?: { showServiceOptions?: boolean }

Default: true (to avoid changing barber/salon/nails)

For Faith House config: set showServiceOptions: false

Then use:

const showOptions = config?.widget?.showServiceOptions !== false && !isSoberLiving;
(If you do this, still keep the automatic sober living disable.)

D) Verify no regressions:

Faith House /demo/faith-house: options/cards are gone, chat input works, bot answers program questions, admissions flow still triggers by text (“schedule a tour”), and leads/appointments log correctly.

Barber/Salon/Nails demos: their booking/service selection UI remains unchanged.

DELIVERABLES

Code changes removing the widget option cards for sober living

Quick manual test notes:

Faith House: asked about programs -> AI answers

“schedule a tour” typed -> internal admissions flow still works

crisis phrase -> crisis response still works

barber demo -> service/booking UI unchanged

END.
