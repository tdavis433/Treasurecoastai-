You are working on an existing production-grade multi-tenant SaaS called Treasure Coast AI:
	•	Backend: Node/Express + Postgres + Drizzle ORM
	•	Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + shadcn/Tailwind-style components
	•	Features already in place:
	•	Multi-tenant: super-admin, client dashboard
	•	AI orchestrator (OpenAI) with chat widget
	•	Leads, bookings/appointments, analytics, Stripe billing
	•	Faith House bot (sober living) with:
	•	In-chat booking flow (“Book a tour” / “Schedule a phone call”)
	•	Appointment type field (tour | phone_call)
	•	Dashboard booking type badges + “View Chat”
	•	Executive summary stats
	•	Regression already done; platform stable

Now we want to finish and polish the Faith House experience with two big goals:

	1.	Create a hard-separated DEMO vs LIVE setup for Faith House (no data bleed, no confusion).
	2.	Build a Treasure Coast AI–branded Faith House demo landing page + visually stunning demo dashboard that looks like a high-budget, professional product.

You must keep architecture intact, follow existing patterns, and not break any existing tenants.

⸻

0. Constraints & Principles
	•	Do NOT just add a simple “mode flag” to a single tenant.
	•	DEMO and LIVE must be separate tenants with separate bots, separate data.
	•	Demo data must be resettable without touching live data.
	•	Live data must always be real. No fake/demo data may appear in live views.
	•	Visual style:
	•	Primary brand: Treasure Coast AI (dark background, neon/glass, blue/teal/purple accents, modern SaaS look).
	•	Secondary flavor: Faith House content (sober living, calm tone), but not a clone of their website.
	•	Use existing tech stack and design system (React, current layout components, CSS/Tailwind/shadcn patterns).
	•	No new large dependencies; stick to what’s already in the repo.

⸻

1. DEMO vs LIVE Tenant & Bot Separation

Create and/or confirm a hard separation between Faith House demo and Faith House live.

1.1 Tenants

In the DB/seed layer, define two distinct tenants:
	1.	Faith House DEMO tenant
	•	clientId: faith_house_demo
	•	slug or URL identifier: faith-house-demo
	•	isDemo: true
	•	Description: demo/sandbox tenant for Faith House
	•	Use existing sober-living configuration as a base.
	2.	Faith House LIVE tenant
	•	clientId: faith_house_live
	•	slug: faith-house-live
	•	isDemo: false
	•	Description: real production tenant for the landlord (no seeded data).

Ensure all relevant tables (conversations, sessions, leads, appointments/bookings, analytics, etc.) always store and filter by clientId. This should already exist; just verify and adjust where needed so both tenants are cleanly supported.

1.2 Bots

Define separate bots for each tenant:
	•	DEMO bot:
	•	botId: faith_house_demo_main
	•	clientId: faith_house_demo
	•	type: sober_living
	•	Uses the latest sober living system prompt, tuned for:
	•	Warm, professional tone
	•	Clear “Book a tour” / “Schedule a phone call” flows
	•	Collecting name, phone, email, preferred time, notes
	•	Creating structured bookings with type = 'tour' | 'phone_call'.
	•	LIVE bot:
	•	botId: faith_house_live_main
	•	clientId: faith_house_live
	•	type: sober_living
	•	Same logic/system prompt structure, but live data only.

Make sure any place that previously referenced a single faith_house_main bot is updated to correctly handle demo vs live IDs.

⸻

2. Separate Routes / Entry Points (Demo vs Live)

Implement clear, separate entry points so demo and live never get mixed.

2.1 Demo Landing Page (main focus)

Create a new route, e.g.:
	•	Frontend route: /demo/faith-house

This is a Treasure Coast AI–branded product showcase for Faith House, wired to the DEMO tenant and DEMO bot:
	•	clientId = faith_house_demo
	•	botId = faith_house_demo_main

We’ll define the design in Section 3.

2.2 Live Widget / Live Integration

Ensure there is a separate route or config for the live widget, e.g.:
	•	/widget/faith-house-live (or follow existing widget route patterns)

This must use:
	•	clientId = faith_house_live
	•	botId = faith_house_live_main

The live widget is what will eventually be embedded on the real website. It should not show any demo labels or demo data.

2.3 Dashboard Access
	•	Super-admin:
	•	Can access both faith_house_demo and faith_house_live tenants.
	•	UI should show a clear badge/label when viewing demo.
	•	Landlord (client):
	•	Live landlord login must map only to faith_house_live.
	•	They should never see or access the faith_house_demo tenant from their normal login.

⸻

3. Demo Reset Endpoint (Sandbox Only)

Implement a safe demo reset mechanism that affects only the demo tenant.

3.1 Backend endpoint

Create an admin-only endpoint, e.g.:
	•	POST /api/admin/demo/faith-house/reset

Behavior:
	•	Hard-check that target client is demo:
	•	Look up clientId = faith_house_demo.
	•	Ensure isDemo === true.
	•	If not demo, abort and log an error; do not reset anything.
	•	For the demo tenant only, reset or re-seed:
	•	Conversations / chat sessions
	•	Leads
	•	Appointments/bookings
	•	Relevant analytics/summaries

You can either:
	•	Delete and re-insert sample rows, or
	•	Mark as deleted and re-seed, depending on existing patterns.

3.2 Seed “pretty demo” data

After reset, seed a small realistic dataset for faith_house_demo:
	•	Conversations:
	•	A few example threads with realistic questions about Faith House, rules, availability, etc.
	•	Leads:
	•	3–5 leads with different notes (family member calling, upcoming release from treatment, etc.).
	•	Bookings:
	•	A mix of:
	•	2–3 tour appointments
	•	2–3 phone_call appointments
	•	With varying statuses (e.g., new, scheduled, completed).
	•	Analytics:
	•	Enough historical data so the executive summary and graphs look alive.

All of this must stay strictly scoped to clientId = faith_house_demo.

3.3 Frontend button

In the super-admin UI (not live landlord UI):
	•	Add a button for the demo tenant only, such as:
	•	Label: “Reset Faith House Demo Data”
	•	Confirm dialog:
	•	“This will reset conversations, leads, bookings, and analytics for the Faith House DEMO tenant only. Live data is NOT affected. Continue?”
	•	This button should call the reset endpoint above.
	•	Do not show this control on the live landlord dashboard.

4. Treasure Coast AI–Branded Faith House Demo Landing Page

Build /demo/faith-house as a Treasure Coast AI showroom that features Faith House, not a clone of their website.

4.1 Layout & structure

Use a full-page layout with:
	•	Dark gradient / subtle textured background (TCAI brand).
	•	Main content centered with a max-width container.

Hero Section (top of page):
	•	Left column:
	•	Small label: Treasure Coast AI – Live Demo
	•	Big headline, e.g.:
	•	“Faith House Sober Living – Powered by Treasure Coast AI”
	•	Subheadline:
	•	1–2 sentences explaining:
	•	Faith House is a structured men’s sober living home in Port St. Lucie.
	•	This is a live AI assistant demo that shows how Treasure Coast AI handles inquiries, tours, and calls.
	•	3–4 bullet value props from the SaaS product perspective, for example:
	•	“24/7 AI assistant that answers questions about your sober living home”
	•	“Converts conversations into tour and phone call bookings”
	•	“Automatically records every booking in the client dashboard”
	•	“Gives staff a clear, real-time view of leads and follow-ups”
	•	A small disclaimer line:
	•	“This page uses a demo environment with simulated data.”
	•	Right column:
	•	A large glassmorphism chat assistant card (see 4.2).

Below hero:
	•	A TCAI-styled feature section, such as:
	•	3 feature cards:
	•	“24/7 AI Conversations”
	•	“Instant Tour & Call Bookings”
	•	“Live Dashboard & Analytics”
	•	Each with:
	•	Icon (chat bubble, calendar, chart, etc.)
	•	1–2 sentence description.
	•	A short “Under the Hood” strip explaining:
	•	Visitor chats with the assistant →
	•	The assistant collects info →
	•	A booking is created (tour/phone_call) →
	•	It appears instantly in the Faith House demo dashboard.

You can adapt layout components already used in other parts of the app (cards, grids, etc.).

4.2 Chat assistant “wow” panel

This is key. The assistant card should look like a premium, big-budget product:
	•	Use a glass card design:
	•	Dark, translucent background
	•	Soft blur
	•	Subtle border/glow with Treasure Coast AI accent color (blue/teal/purple)
	•	Rounded corners, generous padding
	•	Header bar at top of the card:
	•	Left:
	•	Avatar:
	•	A clean, professional avatar icon (e.g., minimal AI logo or house + sparkle).
	•	Text:
	•	Title: Faith House Assistant
	•	Subtitle: Sober Living • Demo
	•	Right:
	•	Small “Powered by Treasure Coast AI” text or logo.
	•	Chat area:
	•	Use the existing chat widget component but ensure:
	•	Bot bubbles: subtle gradient or tinted, on-brand colors.
	•	User bubbles: contrasting but harmonious.
	•	Good line height, spacing, margins.
	•	Scrollable area with neat scroll behavior (no ugly default scrollbars if easily styled).
	•	Connect it to:
	•	clientId = faith_house_demo
	•	botId = faith_house_demo_main
	•	Full functionality:
	•	Faith House system prompt
	•	In-chat bookings (tour / phone_call)
	•	Booking creation in DB for the demo tenant.

This card needs to feel like “big SaaS,” not a plain form.

⸻

5. Demo Client Dashboard – Visual Polish (Treasure Coast AI Theme)

For the Faith House DEMO tenant dashboard (client/staff view):
	•	Keep the existing structure (overview, conversations, leads, bookings).
	•	Upgrade the visual polish to match Treasure Coast AI’s dark neon/glass aesthetic.

5.1 Executive Summary section

At the top of the demo dashboard:
	•	Show 3–4 stat cards (TCAI-style):
	•	“Conversations (Last 7 Days)”
	•	“Leads Captured”
	•	“Tours Booked”
	•	“Phone Calls Scheduled”

Each card:
	•	Large number
	•	Label
	•	Subtext: “Last 7 days”
	•	Soft glow/border using TCAI accent colors

Ensure these cards use consistent heights, padding, typographic scale, and spacing.

5.2 Tables & lists (Conversations, Leads, Bookings)

Polish the demo tenant’s tables to look professional:
	•	Consistent row heights and padding
	•	Clean header backgrounds for table columns
	•	Hover states that are subtle but present
	•	Booking type badges:
	•	tour → cyan/blue badge with label “Tour”
	•	phone_call → purple/indigo badge with label “Phone Call”
	•	Unknown/legacy → gray badge with “Appointment”
	•	Booking status handling:
	•	Status dropdown or badges (e.g., new, scheduled, completed) styled consistently.
	•	“View Chat” actions:
	•	Use a consistent button or link style with icon + label.
	•	Place them consistently in the same column for each row.

5.3 Demo-only cues

On the demo tenant dashboard only:
	•	Add a small badge/label near the top:
	•	Demo Environment
	•	Short helper text:
	•	“This dashboard shows simulated demo data for The Faith House AI assistant.”

Do NOT add this to the live landlord tenant.

⸻

6. Live Tenant – Keep It Clean & Real

For the Faith House LIVE tenant:
	•	No “Demo” text or labels anywhere.
	•	No seeded fake entries.
	•	No demo reset button.

It should look like:
	•	A professional, clean client dashboard using the same TCAI theme but:
	•	Only real conversations, leads, bookings from clientId = faith_house_live.
	•	All demo-only features must respect isDemo === true or clientId === faith_house_demo checks before rendering.

⸻

7. QA: Prove There Is No Bleed Between Demo & Live

Before you’re done, run and document these tests:

7.1 Demo-only reset
	•	Create a few live conversations/bookings under faith_house_live.
	•	Call the demo reset endpoint.
	•	Verify:
	•	Live conversations and bookings are unchanged.
	•	Only faith_house_demo data is reset and reseeded.

7.2 Side-by-side behavior
	•	Open /demo/faith-house (demo landing page) in one tab:
	•	Interact with the chat, create tour and phone call bookings.
	•	Confirm:
	•	New data appears in demo dashboard only.
	•	Trigger live chat for faith_house_live (via its live widget route) in another tab:
	•	Interact and create bookings.
	•	Confirm:
	•	New data appears only in the live tenant dashboard.
	•	No demo data is mixed into live, and vice versa.

7.3 Login separation
	•	Log in as:
	•	Super-admin:
	•	Confirm you can see both tenants (demo + live) clearly labeled.
	•	Live landlord (client staff for faith_house_live):
	•	Confirm you see only live data and no demo controls.

7.4 UI visual check
	•	/demo/faith-house:
	•	Looks like Treasure Coast AI product demo.
	•	Chat UI looks premium and modern.
	•	Demo dashboard:
	•	Executive summary, tables, badges, and actions are visually consistent and clean.
	•	Live dashboard:
	•	Same core UI quality, but no demo labels or fake data.

⸻

8. Documentation

Update or create the following docs:
	1.	docs/faith-house-demo-script.md:
	•	Add an updated section describing:
	•	/demo/faith-house usage
	•	How the assistant, bookings, and dashboard tie together
	•	That it uses the demo tenant with sample data.
	2.	docs/faith-house-demo-vs-live.md (NEW, if not present):
	•	Explain:
	•	The difference between:
	•	faith_house_demo vs faith_house_live
	•	How demo reset works
	•	Guarantees:
	•	Demo reset never touches live data
	•	Live dashboards never show seeded data
	•	How to access:
	•	Demo landing page
	•	Demo dashboard
	•	Live widget
	•	Live landlord dashboard

Keep docs short but precise.

	•	Multi-tenant handling
	•	Drizzle schema and migrations
	•	React routing/layout components
	•	Styling (cards, badges, etc.)
