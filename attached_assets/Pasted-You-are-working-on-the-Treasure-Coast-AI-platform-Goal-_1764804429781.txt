You are working on the Treasure Coast AI platform.

Goal:
Verify that when I create a brand-new client from the admin UI, their AI assistant behaves exactly like the demo bots:
	•	Answers FAQs correctly
	•	Detects booking intent
	•	Collects lead info
	•	Sends the external booking link
	•	Logs conversations & leads
	•	Updates analytics

This must all happen through the normal UI, no DB hacks.

1. Create a Brand-New Client via UI

Using the super-admin dashboard only:
	1.	Create a new client/workspace:
	•	Name: “Test Barber Shop – Behavior Parity”
	2.	Create a bot for this client:
	•	Name: “Test Barber Bot”
	3.	Fill in bot/client business info:
	•	Hours
	•	Address
	•	Services (haircut, beard trim, skin fade, etc.)
	4.	Set Booking URL (admin-only field):
	•	e.g. https://example.com/test-barber/book

Do not hard-code anything special for this client; just use the standard UI flow.

2. Run Demo Client Baseline

Pick an existing demo client that you know works (e.g. “Sunset Coffee” or the barbershop demo).

Using the demo page widget:
	1.	Ask:
	•	“What services do you offer?”
	•	“What are your hours today?”
	•	“Where are you located?”
	2.	Trigger booking:
	•	“I want to book an appointment for tomorrow.”
	•	Provide name, contact, service, time.

Record how the demo bot behaves:
	•	wording format
	•	sequence (asks questions → confirms → sends booking link)
	•	that it sends an external booking link
	•	that a lead appears in dashboards

This is the baseline behavior.

3. Run the Same Flow on the New Client

Now, using the public widget or demo page for the new “Test Barber Shop – Behavior Parity” client:
	1.	Ask the same questions in the same order:
	•	“What services do you offer?”
	•	“What are your hours today?”
	•	“Where are you located?”
	2.	Trigger booking with similar messages:
	•	“I want to book a haircut for tomorrow.”
	•	Provide:
	•	Name: Alex Test
	•	Phone/email
	•	Service: Haircut
	•	Time: 3 PM

All of this must go through the normal widget UI – no manual API calls.

4. Verify Behavior Parity

Compare the new client bot to the demo bot:
	1.	Answer style & flow
	•	Does it answer hours/location/services correctly?
	•	Does it ask for similar lead/booking details?
	•	Does it clearly send the booking URL and tell the user to finish booking there?
	2.	Booking link
	•	Does it send the correct booking URL you set for this client?
	•	Does it avoid claiming it processed payment or confirmed internally?
	3.	Lead capture & dashboards
	•	In the client dashboard for the new barber shop:
	•	Lead exists for Alex Test
	•	Marked as booking-related
	•	Shows service + preferred time
	•	In the admin dashboard:
	•	Same lead + conversation visible
	•	Analytics updated (convos, leads, bookings) just like for the demo client.
	4.	Engine parity
	•	Confirm both demo and new client are using the same conversation orchestrator / chat pipeline (no special-case code).

If any behavior differs in a way that suggests separate logic paths (e.g., demo bot can book but new clients can’t), refactor so:
	•	all chat entry points use the unified orchestrator,
	•	the only differences come from configuration (business info, bookingUrl, knowledge), not code.

5. Final Report

Produce a short Behavior Parity QA Report:
	•	Did the new client’s assistant behave the same as the demo?
	•	Any differences in:
	•	booking flow
	•	lead capture
	•	responses
	•	dashboards
	•	What you fixed (if anything) to ensure all future new clients automatically get full demo-level capabilities with just configuration.
