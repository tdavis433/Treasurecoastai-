You are continuing improvements to the Treasure Coast AI SaaS in this Replit project.

Auth and Faith House parity should now be fixed from previous blocks.

────────────────────
GOAL OF THIS BLOCK
────────────────────
1. Fix **user management** inside a workspace (Create Login, list, lifecycle).
2. Fix **New Client / Workspace wizard** validation and UX.
3. Ensure basic editing of workspace metadata works.

────────────────────
PART A – WORKSPACE USER MANAGEMENT
────────────────────
Target the “Workspace Users” / “Create Login” flow for a QA workspace (not Faith House).

1. **Validation**
   - Email:
     - Required.
     - Must be a valid email format.
   - Password:
     - Required.
     - Minimum 8 characters.
     - Should include letters and numbers at least.

   Behavior:
   - If invalid → show inline errors + prevent submit.
   - No silent failure, no creation of broken users.

2. **User creation**
   - When a user is created via “Create Login”:
     - Associate them with the correct workspace id.
     - Immediately show the new user in the workspace user list (trigger refetch/invalidate cache as needed).
   - After hard refresh, user should still appear.

3. **User login**
   - A newly created workspace user should:
     - Log in using the client login route.
     - Land on the correct workspace dashboard.
     - Not see super admin routes.

4. **Edit / Disable / Delete (if supported)**
   - If the UI currently has actions to edit or delete a user:
     - Implement them fully:
       - Edit email (with validation).
       - Disable or delete user (prefer soft delete/disable).
     - Ensure a disabled/deleted user can no longer log in.

If the product does NOT intend to support editing/deleting users from UI yet:
- Hide or disable such controls to avoid “fake” buttons.

────────────────────
PART B – NEW CLIENT / WORKSPACE WIZARD
────────────────────
Fix the “New Client” button and wizard behavior.

1. **Open reliably**
   - Clicking “New Client” should always open the wizard modal.

2. **Step 1 validation**
   - Required: Business Name, Contact Email (and any other essential fields).
   - Clicking Next with missing/invalid fields:
     - Shows inline errors.
     - Keeps the modal open – NO silent close.
   - With valid values:
     - Moves to Step 2.

3. **Scrolling and layout**
   - Wizard content should be scrollable without hiding the Next/Back buttons.
   - On smaller laptop screens, user should still be able to reach all fields and actions.

4. **Completion**
   - Completing all steps must create a new workspace record.
   - New workspace should appear in Clients list without manual refresh if possible.

────────────────────
PART C – EDIT WORKSPACE METADATA
────────────────────
For a QA workspace (e.g., newly created “QA Full Lifecycle Workspace”):

- Implement or fix editing workspace metadata:
  - Name.
  - Contact email.
  - Any public-facing labels.

- Ensure changes:
  - Save successfully.
  - Reflect in:
    - Clients list card.
    - Workspace overview header.
  - Persist across reload.
