What I would fix before calling it “template-perfect”
1) Fix the timing inconsistency

Your FAQ says “20–30 minutes,” but your services include 45 min and 1 hour options. That’s a credibility hit.

Better FAQ answer:

“Most cuts are 30–45 minutes. Fades and combo services usually run 45–60 minutes depending on the style.”

2) Add the 3 FAQs that stop 80% of back-and-forth

Right now you’re missing the heavy hitters:

Cancellation / no-show policy

Late policy

Can I pick a barber / request a specific stylist?

These reduce friction AND make you look professional.

3) Add “Pick a barber” as an optional step (even if you’re redirecting)

Even if you’re not doing live slots in-chat, the flow should ask:

“Any barber is fine, or do you want someone specific?”

That improves conversions for repeat customers.

4) Add one “upsell add-on” CTA (prints money)

A single button like:

Add-ons → “Do you offer enhancements like hot towel, eyebrow, designs?”

Then the bot can recommend add-ons before the booking handoff.

5) Make “prices are starting prices” match your service list

You say “starting prices,” but you list exact prices. That’s fine — just clarify:

“Prices shown are typical for most clients. Specialty styles, extra length, or design work may vary.”

6) Add “Talk to a human” and “Call now”

You need a safety valve for edge cases:

Call the shop

Text us

Speak to staff

This saves bookings when someone’s being difficult or the booking link is acting up.

Alternative approaches
Option A (best v1 stability)

Your current setup + Quick Book + redirect + demo confirmation.
This scales to tons of clients without breaking.

Option B (premium later)

Add “Live slots in chat” for Square users as an upgrade.
Don’t mix it into the base template yet.

Practical action plan to finish the template

Update the 1 FAQ timing answer (consistency).

Add 3 FAQs: cancellation/no-show, late policy, request barber/stylist.

Add 2 CTAs: Add-ons + Talk to a human.

Make Quick Book ask one extra question optionally: Any barber or someone specific? (store it on the intent/lead).

Turn this into a seed JSON so every new barber/salon workspace loads identically.

Seed JSON (copy/paste structure)

Use this as the canonical template payload (adjust keys to your system):
