You are Replit AI acting as Lead Engineer + UX Designer on this codebase.

Your task in this pass is very specific:

Take the existing Super Admin Control Center page (the one that shows “Treasure Coast AI – Control Center” with the bot list and KPI tiles) and upgrade it into a full SaaS owner control center with:

Workspace-level views

Global analytics

System status & logs

Quick actions

Rich bot metrics
…while keeping the existing style, layout, and dark theme.

Do not break the existing routing or working features.
You are enhancing and expanding the current /super-admin area.

1️⃣ FIND & UNDERSTAND CURRENT SUPER ADMIN UI

Locate the current Super Admin “Control Center” page:

The page showing:

“Treasure Coast AI – Control Center” in the top-left

“Dashboard Overview”

total bots / active / demo / paused KPI tiles

left sidebar list of chatbots

big grid of bot cards.

Identify:

The route (likely /super-admin or similar).

The main React component and layout file(s) used for this page.

Any associated hooks, context, or API routes that feed bot data into this page.

You will be modifying this page and adding additional routes/components under the super-admin section, not starting from scratch.

2️⃣ ADD A REAL “WORKSPACES” LAYER (BUSINESS VIEW FOR OWNER)

Right now, this page only shows bots.
You must add a Workspaces overview so the owner can see and manage each client business.

2.1. Workspace List Section

Add a Workspaces panel/section (can be a tab, sub-page, or area on the main dashboard):

Use a shadcn Table or card grid.

Each row/card must show:

Workspace name (business name)

Owner email (if available)

Status: active, paused, or cancelled

Plan tier (Starter / Growth / Pro or whatever exists)

Bots count

Created date

Last active (based on recent conversation/analytics if available)

Each workspace row/card must have actions:

“View details”

“Suspend / Reactivate workspace”

“Impersonate workspace”

“Open Stripe / Billing overview” (if billing is wired)

Use the existing dark/neon style.

2.2. Workspace Detail View

When you click a workspace row/card, open a Workspace Detail page or drawer:

Show:

Workspace name, industry, contact email

Plan tier + limits

Usage snapshot:

conversations last 30 days

leads last 30 days

appointments last 30 days

Current workspace status

List of that workspace’s bots:

bot name

status

last active

Actions:

Impersonate workspace (if impersonation is already implemented, reuse it; otherwise, wire a simple version where super admin can view the client dashboard as that workspace).

Suspend / Reactivate workspace.

Open Stripe subscription details (if Stripe integration exists).

Put this under a clear route like:
/super-admin/workspaces and /super-admin/workspaces/[workspaceId] (or equivalent in your router).

3️⃣ ADD GLOBAL ANALYTICS PANEL (OWNER VIEW)

Extend the /super-admin main dashboard to include global analytics, not just bot counts.

Above or below the existing “Total Bots / Active / Demo / Paused” tiles, add:

KPI cards for the ENTIRE platform:

Total conversations (last 7 days)

Total leads (last 7 days)

Total appointments (last 7 days)

Total active workspaces

Charts:

Conversations per day (last 7 or 30 days) as a line or area chart

Leads per day as a bar/line chart

Optionally, appointments per day

Use shadcn cards + whatever chart library is already present in the project (or a minimal one if needed).
All analytics should be read-only and aggregated across all workspaces.

4️⃣ ADD A “SYSTEM STATUS” & “SYSTEM LOGS” EXPERIENCE
4.1. System Status Indicator

At the top-right of the Super Admin header (where you currently show “All Systems Operational”), turn this into a real status indicator:

State text:

“All Systems Operational”

or “Degraded Performance”

or “Incidents Detected”

Color-coded badge based on recent error rates or log severity.

It’s okay to use a simplified heuristic for now (e.g. error count in last N minutes).

4.2. System Logs Page

Add a new Super Admin page:

Route: /super-admin/logs

This must show a table of system logs, including:

timestamp

level (info/warn/error)

workspace (if applicable)

route or source (e.g. /api/chat, stripe/webhook, auth)

message or error summary

Add:

filters by:

log level

workspace

date range

search by message text

If you already have any logging mechanism, surface it here.
If not, create a simple logs table in the DB and log basic events (errors, Stripe events, impersonation events).

5️⃣ UPGRADE BOT LIST INTO A REAL “BOT MANAGEMENT” PANEL

The existing bot grid is good, but it needs richer data to feel like a real control center.

You must:

Keep the existing layout and styling, but enhance each bot card so it also shows:

Parent workspace name

Conversations in last 7 days

Leads in last 7 days

Appointments in last 7 days

Last active time

Add filter controls above the bot grid:

Search by bot name

Filter by workspace

Filter by bot status (active/demo/paused)

Optional filter by industry

Add click handlers:

Click on a bot card → open detail drawer or page:

bot info

workspace

recent stats

quick link: “Impersonate workspace & open this bot’s analytics” (i.e., jump into the client-side /bots/:botId/analytics view in impersonation mode).

6️⃣ ADD A SUPER ADMIN “QUICK ACTIONS” BAR

At the top of the /super-admin dashboard (below the header), add a strip with Quick Actions such as:

“Create New Workspace”

“Create Demo Workspace”

“Add New Bot”

“Go to Global Analytics”

“Open Logs”

These can be shadcn buttons with icons.

They should open modals/forms or navigate to the appropriate pages.

7️⃣ UI/UX & CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS

While implementing all of the above:

Reuse the existing dark, neon, glassmorphism style.

Use shadcn/ui components for:

cards

tables

badges

buttons

tabs

modals/drawers

Ensure:

consistent padding, spacing, and typography with the current dashboard

responsive behavior on common screen sizes

loading states (skeletons) while data is fetched

empty states for lists with zero items (“No workspaces yet”, “No logs yet”, etc.)

Do not break existing /super-admin logic; just enhance it and add the new sections & routes.

8️⃣ BACKEND & SECURITY HOOKS

You must:

Reuse existing auth & role logic so that /super-admin and all its sub-routes are accessible ONLY to super-admin users.

All new APIs for:

fetching workspaces

fetching global analytics

fetching system logs
must be super-admin protected.

Do not expose these endpoints to normal client users.

If any needed endpoints are missing, add them in a clean, consistent style with Zod validation and proper TypeScript typing.

9️⃣ FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE YOU STOP

Before you finish, you MUST:

Confirm /super-admin now contains:

a Workspaces section

a Workspace detail view

a Bot management panel with richer KPIs & filters

Global analytics

System status indicator

Quick actions bar

Confirm there is a /super-admin/logs (or equivalent) page with:

system logs table

filters/search

Confirm:

routes are secured to super-admin only

nothing broke for the existing admin flows

the UI looks consistent with the rest of the app

Output a short summary listing:

new files created

key files modified

new routes and components added

🔥 Begin now.
Upgrade the existing Super Admin “Control Center” into a full, professional SaaS owner dashboard with all the features above, while keeping the styling and theme consistent with the current page.
