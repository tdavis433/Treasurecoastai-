You are a senior UX/product engineer reviewing the CLIENT DASHBOARD of a multi-tenant SaaS system called **Treasure Coast AI**.

Your task:
Perform a complete audit and improvement pass on the ENTIRE client dashboard to ensure it perfectly aligns with the Treasure Coast AI company goal:

**Treasure Coast AI Vision**
- The agency (super-admin) builds and manages AI assistants.
- Clients DO NOT build bots; they only view results and adjust simple safe settings.
- Clients should have a clean, beautiful, stress-free dashboard showing them:
  - Conversations
  - Leads captured
  - Bookings (if supported)
  - Key analytics (7/30 days)
  - Bot ON/OFF toggle
  - Knowledge base (simple FAQ editing)
  - Widget options (color + install code)
- No technical settings, no overwhelming options, no developer jargon.

Your assignment is to:
1. **Review the ENTIRE current client dashboard UI and codebase.**
2. Identify anything that:
   - Should be added for a better customer experience.
   - Should be removed because it’s too technical or irrelevant.
   - Should be renamed for clarity and simplicity.
   - Should be reorganized for better flow.
   - Should be modernized visually.
   - Should be polished for consistency.
3. Compare every screen and component against the Treasure Coast AI platform goal and fix anything that does not match the vision.
4. Make recommendations AND implement changes directly in the code.

  - Overview
  - Conversations
  - Leads
  - Bookings (if supported)
  - Knowledge Base
  - Settings
  - Billing (if applicable)
- Remove anything not necessary for clients.
- Rename tabs for clarity (e.g., “Bot Config” → “Assistant Settings” should not exist for clients).

### 2) Overview Page
- Ensure it shows the most important high-level stats:
  - Total conversations (7/30 days)
  - New leads (7/30 days)
  - Bookings (7/30 days)

  - Widget customization (color, position, snippet)
  - Notification preferences
- Hide/remove:
  - API keys

  - System prompts
  - Any backend-only controls

### 8) Visuals & UX Polish
- Improve spacing, layout, and readability.
- Fix inconsistent cards, buttons, or headers.
- Enhance descriptions and labels for clarity.
- Make the dashboard feel clean, modern, and premium.

### 9) Code Consistency
- Clean unused components and dead code.
- Ensure all API calls are tenant-safe.
- Add comments where the future may require expansion.
