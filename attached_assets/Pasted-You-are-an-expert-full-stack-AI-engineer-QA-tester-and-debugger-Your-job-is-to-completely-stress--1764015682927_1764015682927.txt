You are an expert full-stack AI engineer, QA tester, and debugger. Your job is to completely stress-test, analyze, optimize, and repair this entire chatbot project. Perform the following steps in order:

1. Full Project Audit
	•	Scan every file, every component, every dependency.
	•	Map out the full architecture: frontend, backend, API calls, handlers, routes, state, database, admin pages, and UI logic.
	•	Identify missing files, broken imports, unused code, redundant logic, and security risks.

2. Functional Deep Testing

Go through every single feature of the chatbot:
	•	Message handling
	•	Context flow
	•	Memory/state
	•	Error catching
	•	API requests
	•	Admin panel
	•	Authentication (if any)
	•	Settings, toggles, and dashboards
	•	Analytics logic
	•	Response quality
	•	Loading states
	•	UI/UX flow

Simulate edge cases, abusive inputs, long inputs, rapid firing, empty queries, API failures, timeouts, and user mistakes.

Document ANY issue.

3. Output a Full Issues List

Create a structured report with:
	•	All bugs
	•	All warnings
	•	All UX inconsistencies
	•	All broken or unfinished functions
	•	All missing validation
	•	All incorrect or outdated code
	•	All performance problems
	•	All possible improvements

Each item must include:
	•	File name
	•	Line number
	•	What’s wrong
	•	Why it matters
	•	The fix

4. Auto-Fix & Rewrite Code

For every issue found:
	•	Rewrite the corrected code
	•	Replace outdated patterns
	•	Improve readability and structure
	•	Optimize for speed
	•	Harden against crashes
	•	Ensure clean and modern best practices

Always output the full corrected code block, ready to paste.

5. Enhance the Entire App

Upgrade the project by:
	•	Improving API reliability
	•	Adding missing error handling
	•	Making the UI cleaner and more professional
	•	Standardizing formatting
	•	Increasing response accuracy
	•	Improving admin dashboard flows
	•	Upgrading analytics tracking
	•	Making the code modular, scalable, and easier to maintain

6. Final Deliverables

When finished, return:

A. A full diagnostic report
Clear, organized list of everything wrong + everything fixed.

B. Fully rewritten improved code
Every file needing correction should be returned as a full updated code block.

C. Recommendations for next steps
Shortlist upgrades that will take this chatbot from “works” to “elite.”
