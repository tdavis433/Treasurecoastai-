REPLIT AGENT MODE — FINAL “MEGA TEST + AUTO-FIX + REPORT” (POST-INTEGRATION)
Treasure Coast AI — Full Platform Validation + Repair Pass

GOAL
When you finish implementing all features (Agency Onboarding Console, Website Import, Theme Match, Launch Checklist, Client Health/Errors, 24h Preview Link, QA Gate, No-Payments guard, tenant isolation hardening), run a full end-to-end “mega test” across the entire platform, aggressively try to break it like real humans + attackers, automatically fix what’s broken, re-test until stable, and then produce a huge summary report I can paste back to my ChatGPT so we can fine-tune anything remaining.

ABSOLUTE GUARDRAILS (BLOCKERS)
1) NO PAYMENT PROCESSING — EVER
- No checkout UI, no card/ACH/wallet capture, no payment intents/tokens, no refunds/chargebacks/subscriptions/invoices.
- External booking is allowed ONLY as HTTPS redirect off-domain after logging intent/redirect events.
- Any payment provider integrations beyond outbound linking are BLOCKER.

2) MULTI-TENANT ISOLATION
- All reads/writes MUST be tenant/workspace scoped on the server.
- UI hiding is not security.
- Any IDOR / cross-tenant data leak is BLOCKER.

3) DEMO QUALITY
- No raw stack traces shown to end users.
- Friendly errors only.
- No dead buttons/placeholder pages exposed.

SECURITY / PRIVACY RULES
- Never print passwords or secrets in output.
- Never commit credentials.
- Redact any tokens and any PII in logs/reports.
- If referencing credentials in the report, redact like a*****3 / d*****3.

RUN CONTEXT
Base URL:
https://treasure-coast-ai-platform--mlgrushskill.replit.app

Known demo credentials (DO NOT PRINT PASSWORDS):
- Admin username: admin (password redacted)
- Demo client username: demo_faith_house (password redacted)

IMPORTANT: If you need local test credentials, create temporary test users and delete them at end.

=====================================================================
PHASE 0 — PRE-FLIGHT (STOP IF FAIL)
=====================================================================
0.1 Build + Typecheck + Unit Tests + Guards (must pass)
Run:
- bash ./scripts/guard-no-payments.sh
- npx tsc --noEmit
- npx vitest run
- npm run build

If any fails: fix immediately, re-run until all pass.

0.2 Health checks
- GET /api/health (public)
- GET /api/health/internal (super admin only) — must not leak without auth

Confirm:
- db ok + latency reasonable
- ai configured
- testModeAllowed behavior correct (noIframe dev gating if present)

=====================================================================
PHASE 1 — STATIC REPO SCAN (PAYMENTS/SECRETS/FOOTGUNS)
=====================================================================
1.1 No-payments deep scan (repo-wide)
Search keywords:
stripe, square, paypal, checkout, payment, payment_intent, client_secret, invoice, subscription, billing, refund, webhook
Report each match with:
- file path + line numbers
- whether it violates guardrails
Fix any violations by removal or hard-disable with 501 + documentation.

1.2 Secrets + unsafe logging scan
Search for:
OPENAI_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL, SECRET, TOKEN, PASSWORD, AUTH, SESSION, COOKIE, PRIVATE KEY
Ensure:
- nothing is logged
- nothing is committed
- error logs redact emails/phones/tokens

Fix any leaks.

=====================================================================
PHASE 2 — ROUTE + RBAC + TENANT ISOLATION PROOF
=====================================================================
2.1 Route inventory
Print a categorized list of all routes found in server/routes.ts and any other route files:
- public
- widget
- auth
- client dashboard
- admin
- super-admin
- analytics/export
- health/diagnostics
- preview link routes

2.2 RBAC tests (must be explicit)
Test:
- unauthenticated access to protected routes → 401/403
- client user cannot access super-admin routes → 403
- super-admin can access all super-admin routes → 200

2.3 Tenant isolation (IDOR tests)
Perform at least 5 attempted cross-tenant attacks:
- modify IDs in URL params
- modify query params
- replay API calls with different workspaceId/clientId/botId
Expected:
- 401/403 or empty response, NO data leak
If any leak: fix server-side query scoping (NOT UI).

=====================================================================
PHASE 3 — AGENCY ONBOARDING CONSOLE (CORE FLOW TEST)
=====================================================================
Simulate real agency onboarding (admin-led):
3.1 Create a NEW test workspace draft
- Business Name: “Test Client — Mega Test”
- Website URL: use a stable public site (or demo site)
- Add 3 custom notes
- Set booking mode:
  A) External booking with known-good HTTPS URL
  B) Internal booking with notifications enabled (if supported)

3.2 Website import behavior
- Run scan
- Confirm suggestions appear with provenance
- Confirm NOTHING overwrites admin-entered values automatically
- Merge selected (append+dedupe)
- Confirm saved after refresh

3.3 Match Website Theme
- Click “Match Website Theme”
- Confirm primary/accent/theme/logo update OR safe failure
- Confirm manual override works

3.4 Launch checklist behavior
- Confirm checklist updates live (PASS/WARN/FAIL)
- Each item has a direct “Fix” link and is accurate

3.5 Run QA Gate
Verify PASS report includes:
- widget config ok
- test chat ok
- transcript saved
- lead saved (dedupe correct)
- booking intent logged
- redirect logged (if external) OR request created (if internal)
- notification attempt logged (if configured)

3.6 Go Live + Copy Embed
- Confirm status switches to active
- Embed snippet contains NO secrets
- Verify embed loads on /widget-test.html (and ?noIframe=1 in dev if present)

=====================================================================
PHASE 4 — WIDGET + CHAT “REAL HUMAN” STRESS
=====================================================================
Test widget on:
- desktop
- mobile viewport (375px)
- slow network simulation (if possible)

4.1 Basic Q&A (should be helpful, support-first)
Ask:
- services
- hours
- service area
Expect: accurate and short.

4.2 Stress tests
- long message
- emojis/unicode
- rapid-fire 10 sends
Expect: no crash; friendly rate limit if triggered.

4.3 Lead capture
Submit valid and invalid inputs:
- invalid email
- blank required field
- double submit spam
Expect: friendly validation; no duplicate corruption.

4.4 Booking behavior (CRITICAL)
- Trigger booking intent
- Confirm Book Now only redirects externally (HTTPS off-domain)
- Confirm internal request flow creates an appointment/request and logs notifications
Any on-domain payment UI = BLOCKER.

=====================================================================
PHASE 5 — PREVIEW LINK (24H TOKEN) TEST
=====================================================================
5.1 Generate preview link (24h)
Open in incognito:
- works without login
- shows “expires in 24 hours”
- runs correct template/bot
- respects booking behavior

5.2 Security
- wrong/expired token fails
- token scoped to workspace+bot
- rate limited (best effort)

=====================================================================
PHASE 6 — DASHBOARDS + EXPORTS + DATA CONSISTENCY
=====================================================================
6.1 Client dashboard (view-only)
Login as the new test client user (created during onboarding)
Verify:
- overview loads
- conversations transcript displays message bodies
- leads show correct record
- bookings show correct intent/request

6.2 Admin parity
Check admin dashboards show exact matching counts for same workspace/time window.

6.3 Analytics export
- Ensure tenant isolation: export uses session clientId only
- Sanitize filename and CSV content
- Verify no CSV injection vulnerabilities (prefix = + - @ with apostrophe)

Fix if needed.

=====================================================================
PHASE 7 — RELIABILITY + ERROR HANDLING + RECOVERY
=====================================================================
7.1 Friendly errors
Force:
- wrong login
- invalid payload to an endpoint
Expect: friendly, no stack traces.

7.2 Timeouts/fallback
Simulate AI timeout:
- verify fallback message
- verify lead capture fallback works

7.3 Retry logic
Verify critical writes retry once (lead + transcript) on transient errors without duplicates.

7.4 Client Health/Errors card
Confirm it displays correct:
- last activity
- last errors (redacted)
- notification last attempt

=====================================================================
PHASE 8 — CLEANUP (REQUIRED)
=====================================================================
Delete ONLY the test workspace created:
- “Test Client — Mega Test”
Confirm:
- test client login no longer works
- workspace is gone
- no other tenants affected

=====================================================================
AUTOMATION REQUIREMENTS (MUST IMPLEMENT IF MISSING)
=====================================================================
A) Create scripts/final-mega-test.sh
- runs the full command suite:
  - guard-no-payments
  - tsc
  - vitest
  - build
  - widget-e2e-test.sh (if present)
  - route smoke tests via curl (RBAC + health)
- exits non-zero on failure

B) Ensure scripts produce clean logs and redact sensitive data.

=====================================================================
FINAL REPORT (PASTEABLE OUTPUT)
=====================================================================
Create a single file:
MEGA_TEST_REPORT.md

Must include:
1) GO/NO-GO
2) All commands run + PASS outputs
3) Full checklist PASS/FAIL per phase
4) Findings by severity (BLOCKER/HIGH/MED/LOW) with:
   - exact route/page
   - reproduction steps
   - expected vs actual
   - fix applied (file path + line numbers)
5) No Payments compliance proof
6) Tenant isolation proof (5 attack attempts + outcomes)
7) “Safe Demo Path” (exact clicks + 5 questions)
8) What to re-test after changes

Then print a short summary in console:
- total issues found
- total fixed
- remaining open (if any)

START NOW AFTER ALL FEATURE WORK IS MERGED.
Do not stop until:
- all gates pass
- mega test passes
- report is generated
- test workspace cleanup done
