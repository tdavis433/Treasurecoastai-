You are working inside the Treasure Coast AI SaaS codebase on Replit.

Context:
- Multiple QA passes have been completed.
- Recent work fixed:
  - Duplicate slug/email validation (with inline errors).
  - Appointment Types discoverability in the Booking & Links panel.
  - Booking data extraction to use user messages only (data integrity).
  - Widget embed preview on /dev/embed-test.
  - Multi-tenant isolation and admin/client parity.
  - Client inbox transcripts.
  - Documentation for booking extraction, appointment types, and password reset testing.

At this point, the app is functionally ready to demo and onboard real clients. I do NOT want any new features, wizards, or major UX changes. I only want a light **production hardening & cleanup** pass.

Please do the following:

1) Run tests & basic smoke checks
- Run the full test suite (unit/integration/Playwright if configured).
- Make sure:
  - All tests pass.
  - There are no obvious console errors in the main flows:
    - Landing page (/)
    - Admin login (/login → /super-admin)
    - Client login (/login → /client/dashboard for a demo client)
    - A workspace dashboard (overview, leads, bookings)
    - /dev/embed-test
- Only change code if a real bug / flake is exposed.

2) Remove or guard any dev-only logging
- Scan for noisy dev-only `console.log` / debug logging that could:
  - Spam the browser console for real users.
  - Leak internal details to client-side logs.
- Keep important error logging on the server, but:
  - Avoid logging sensitive data (emails, phone numbers, full message text).
  - Wrap any particularly verbose logging in a `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` or similar guard if needed.

3) Copy & UX micro-polish (only where safe)
- Without changing flows or adding features, clean up obvious rough edges in text:
  - Ensure button/label copy is consistent (“Client login” vs “Login”, “Workspace” vs “Client”).
  - Confirm error messages for:
    - Duplicate workspace name.
    - Duplicate email.
    - Invalid login.
    are short, friendly, and non-technical.
- Do NOT rename core entities like “Faith House” or the main demo workspaces.
- Do NOT introduce any new steps or screens.

4) Production config & docs touch-up (code + replit.md)
- In code and/or `replit.md`, make sure the following are clearly documented for production:
  - Required env vars:
    - OpenAI keys.
    - SMTP/email provider for password reset.
    - Allowed frontend origin(s) / CORS.
    - Any secret keys for widget token signing.
  - How to:
    - Enable password reset in production with real SMTP.
    - Configure the base URL / domain for the app.
    - Safely change the default admin password.

- If there are any obvious “TODO” comments that would affect production security (e.g. “TODO: remove this hard-coded secret”, “TODO: relax CORS”), clean those up or document them properly.

5) Final sanity checklist (no code changes unless something is clearly broken)
- As a last pass, manually click through (in dev):
  - Create a new client workspace.
  - Create a login for that workspace.
  - Configure appointment types and widget branding.
  - Run a Test Chat to create a lead + booking.
  - Confirm:
    - Lead and booking data look correct.
    - Admin and client views match.
- Only change code if you see something clearly broken or inconsistent.

Important:
- Do NOT add a client-facing onboarding wizard.
- Do NOT change existing workspace names or demo data.
- Do NOT add any brand-new flows; this is purely a stability/cleanup pass.

When you’re done, please summarize:
- Any bugs you found and fixed.
- Any tests you added/adjusted.
- Any production-specific notes you added to `replit.md`.
