Final GO/NO-GO gates (must pass every time)
Data truth gates

Sober living flows never set bookingIntents.status="confirmed" unless you truly have confirmation (or explicitly handling="demo" + demo_confirmed).

Internal admissions/tour always creates:

an appointments row (status new)

a leads row (or upsert) with bookingIntent=true and bookingStatus="pending_followup"

Session upsert never creates multiple leads for the same (clientId, botId, sessionId).

Safety gates

Crisis keywords → response includes 988 + 911 and your SAMHSA line, logs crisis_redirect, and sets metadata.crisisFlag=true (or equivalent) without storing the user’s raw crisis text.

Medical/clinical questions → bot refuses to give treatment guidance and routes to admissions.

UX gates

“Schedule a Tour” path works with phone OR email.

Double-click / double-submit does not create duplicates.

If any required admissions config is missing, bot falls back to contact capture + follow-up (not broken UI).

What I’d tighten next (to make it bulletproof)

Crisis detection coverage: keywords are solid, but add a small second-pass for phrasing that isn’t explicit (e.g., “I can’t do this anymore”). Keep it conservative to avoid false alarms.

After-hours behavior: even with “24/7 support” listed, you still want a configurable “we’ll call you in the morning” mode for realism.

Analytics sanity: add one dashboard view that shows the sober-living funnel clearly:

intent_detected → lead_upserted → appointment_created → staff_contacted (later)

Alternative approaches (only if you want to go further)

More robust classifier: lightweight structured classification (still code-decided) to reduce keyword misses.

Automated regression suite: Playwright tests for Faith House + one non-recovery demo so template changes can’t break other industries.

Practical action plan (what you do right now)

Run a 10-minute smoke test on /demo/faith-house:

Tour request

Insurance question

Bed availability question

Probation eligibility question

Crisis phrase test

Abandonment test (click CTA then close)

In DB / dashboards verify:

one lead per session (upsert)

appointment created for admissions flows

correct statuses (pending_followup, new)

crisis flag set without sensitive text stored

Add a tiny “production guard”:

if business.type === 'sober_living', hard-block any path that would mark confirmed.

If you want, paste your Golden Path checklist output (pass/fail + any oddities), and I’ll call out any hidden demo-risk immediately.
