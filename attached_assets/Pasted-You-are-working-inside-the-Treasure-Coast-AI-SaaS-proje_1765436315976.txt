You are working inside the Treasure Coast AI SaaS project on Replit.

Goal:
Right now I only see 1–2 polished demos (like Faith House). I want **demo-quality experiences for EVERY template on the platform**, all fully configured and “jam-packed” with knowledge, FAQs, and realistic data.

When I click into a demo for a given template, I want it to feel like a real business:
- Full knowledge base & FAQs in the client panel.
- Conversational AI that actually knows the business.
- Ability to book **appointments / meetings / tours / phone calls / consultations** appropriate to that business.
- Client dashboards and admin dashboards that look “live” with seeded leads, bookings, and conversations.
- **Assistant icons/avatars that visually match the business** (house for sober living, paw for grooming, spa icon, etc.) with a consistent look across all demos.

Do NOT change core flows (login, billing, etc.). This work is about:
- Discovering all templates.
- Creating demo workspaces + assistants per template.
- Filling them with content and data.
- Making the demo pages, widgets, and client dashboards ready to show off.

────────────────────
1. DISCOVER ALL TEMPLATES & DEFINE DEMO WORKSPACES
────────────────────

First, identify **all templates** that currently exist in the platform. This might be via:
- A template config file.
- Seed scripts.
- Hard-coded workspace templates.
- Any “industry presets” logic.

For **every template type** you find (e.g., Faith House / sober living, pet grooming, med spa, real estate, etc.):

1.1 Create a dedicated demo workspace
- Create a **demo workspace** for each template, if it doesn’t already exist.
- Use clear, descriptive names, e.g.:
  - `faith_house_demo` (or existing Faith House demo).
  - `demo_pet_grooming`
  - `demo_med_spa`
  - `demo_real_estate`
  - etc., one per template.
- Each template should have:
  - 1 main demo assistant.
  - Any necessary automations enabled.

1.2 Keep real tenant workspaces separate
- Maintain strict separation between:
  - Demo workspaces (used for public demos and sales).
  - Real client workspaces (created via the New Client wizard, including canonical Faith House used by `demo_faith_house`).
- Demo workspaces must be clearly identifiable (by slug, name, or flags) so seeding/reset logic can operate on them safely, without ever touching real customer data.

────────────────────
2. /DEMOS PAGE – ADD ALL TEMPLATE DEMOS
────────────────────

2.1 Expand /demos index
- On the `/demos` page (or whatever main demo index route exists), add a card for **each template demo workspace**.
- Each card should include:
  - Business/demo name (e.g. “Faith House – Sober Living Facility”, “Paws & Suds – Pet Grooming”, etc.).
  - 1–2 line description of:
    - What type of business it is.
    - What the AI assistant helps with.
  - A clear CTA button like “Open Demo” that links to the appropriate route:
    - For example: `/demo/faith-house`, `/demo/pet-grooming`, `/demo/med-spa`, etc.

2.2 Uniform styling with room for personality
- Use the existing demo design (e.g. `/demo/faith-house`) as the **visual baseline**:
  - Consistent typography.
  - Consistent card layout.
  - Consistent button styles and spacing.
- Each demo card can carry **business-specific visuals** (icon, mini photo, accent color), but the overall page chrome must feel unified and professional.

────────────────────
3. PER-TEMPLATE DEMO PAGES, WIDGET STYLING & ICONS
────────────────────

For each template:

3.1 Individual demo pages
- Create or update **one dedicated demo page** per template, similar to `/demo/faith-house`.
- Each page should include:
  - A headline and description of the fictional business.
  - A short section explaining how Treasure Coast AI helps that type of business.
  - A prominently embedded AI chat widget for that template’s assistant.

3.2 Widget styling
- For all demo pages:
  - Keep widget styling **consistent** with the product:
    - Same base chat UI.
    - Same structure (header, message list, input).
  - Allow template-specific branding:
    - Widget title (e.g., “Faith House AI Assistant”, “Paws & Suds AI Assistant”).
    - Accent color appropriate to that business.
    - Greeting text tailored to the business.

3.3 Assistant icons/avatars (NEW REQUIREMENT)
- For each **demo assistant**, set a business-appropriate icon/avatar that visually matches the niche, for example:
  - Faith House / sober living: a simple house/roof/home icon.
  - Pet grooming: a paw icon or pet silhouette.
  - Med spa: a leaf, droplet, or spa/relaxation icon.
  - Real estate: a building/house/map-pin icon.
  - Other templates: pick intuitive, generic icons that quickly communicate the business type.
- Requirements:
  - Icons should be:
    - Consistent style (line/filled, size, and corner radius) across all demos.
    - Rendered correctly in:
      - Widget header.
      - Any place assistants are listed (assistants list, demo cards on `/demos` if applicable).
  - No placeholder avatars (no generic default heads, broken images, or missing icons) on demo assistants.

────────────────────
4. KNOWLEDGE BASE & FAQS: PACKED FOR EVERY TEMPLATE
────────────────────

For **each template’s demo workspace**, fill out the **client-facing knowledge base and FAQs** so they’re packed with realistic content.

4.1 Persona & system prompt
- Create a **rich persona** for each template’s demo assistant, e.g.:

  - Sober living:
    - “You are a friendly AI assistant for [Facility Name], a sober living home. You help prospective residents and families understand our program, rules, costs, availability, and how to schedule tours and intake calls. You are compassionate, clear, and non-judgmental.”

  - Pet grooming:
    - “You are a warm, upbeat AI assistant for [Grooming Studio Name], a local pet grooming studio. You help pet parents with services, pricing, availability, and booking grooming appointments or consultations.”

  - Med spa / clinic:
    - “You are a professional, reassuring AI assistant for [Med Spa Name], helping visitors understand treatments, pricing ranges, downtime, and booking consults.”

  - Real estate:
    - “You are a responsive AI assistant for [Brokerage/Agent Name], helping buyers and sellers with property info, viewing schedules, and consultations.”

4.2 FAQs
- For each template demo assistant:
  - Add **8–15 realistic FAQs** in the client knowledge/FAQ panel, covering:
    - Services offered (detailed by template).
    - Pricing examples or ranges.
    - How appointments/consultations/tours work.
    - What to expect on the first visit.
    - Policies (cancellations, requirements, limitations).
    - Common concerns & their answers.

Examples:
- For sober living:
  - “What’s the intake process?”
  - “Can I work or attend school while in the program?”
  - “Are visitors allowed?”
- For pet grooming:
  - “Do you groom anxious or reactive dogs?”
  - “How often should my dog be groomed?”
- For med spa:
  - “What’s the downtime for [treatment]?”
  - “Do you offer free consultations?”
- For real estate:
  - “How do property tours work?”
  - “What’s the difference between pre-approval and pre-qualification?”

4.3 Long-form knowledge entries
- For each template:
  - Add **3–5 rich knowledge entries**, e.g.:
    - “[Business] – About Us”
    - “How Our Program Works”
    - “First Visit Checklist”
    - “Our Most Popular Services”
    - “What to Expect from Your First Tour / Appointment”
  - Ensure content is:
    - Cohesive.
    - Not generic boilerplate.
    - Consistent with the demo page copy.

No lorem ipsum. No “coming soon”.

────────────────────
5. APPOINTMENTS / TOURS / CALLS PER TEMPLATE
────────────────────

For each template demo workspace, set up **appointment/booking flows** that match what that business should be doing.

5.1 Hours & availability
- Configure realistic business hours:
  - e.g., Mon–Fri 9am–6pm; Sat 10am–4pm; closed Sunday.

5.2 Appointment types by template
- For each template, configure **appointment types** that make sense:

Examples:
- Sober living facility:
  - “Facility Tour”
  - “Phone Consultation”
  - “Intake Screening Call”
- Pet grooming:
  - “Full Grooming Appointment”
  - “Quick Bath & Brush”
  - “New Client Consultation Call”
- Med spa:
  - “Consultation”
  - “Treatment Session”
  - “Follow-up Visit”
- Real estate:
  - “Property Tour”
  - “Buyer Consultation”
  - “Seller Consultation Call”

- Set durations and any other required fields.

5.3 Chat → booking behavior
- Ensure that for each template demo assistant:
  - The AI is wired (via existing automations) to:
    - Recognize booking intent.
    - Ask for contact details.
    - Create a lead.
    - Create a booking appropriate to the template’s appointment types.

────────────────────
6. DEMO DATA SEEDING & CLIENT DASHBOARDS
────────────────────

I want every template demo’s **client dashboards** to look active and ready to show off.

6.1 Seed leads & bookings for all templates
- Extend the existing demo seeding approach (e.g., `demoSeed.ts`) to handle **all template demo workspaces**.
- For each template’s demo workspace, seed:
  - 10–30 leads with realistic:
    - Names, emails, phone numbers.
    - Statuses (New, Contacted, Scheduled, Completed, etc.).
    - Tags (e.g., “tour-request”, “consult-request”, “high-intent”, “website-chat”).
  - Several bookings:
    - Using the correct appointment types for that template.
    - With a mix of dates (recent and upcoming).
    - With varied statuses (Pending, Confirmed, Completed, No-Show).

6.2 Seed conversations
- For each template demo:
  - Seed a set of conversations where:
    - Visitors ask questions typical for that business.
    - The assistant answers using the knowledge base.
    - Some conversations end with a booking; others are info-only.

6.3 Client dashboards
- Verify that for each template demo’s client login (if applicable), the dashboard shows:
  - Non-zero leads, bookings, and conversations.
  - Charts with plausible data.
  - Leads, bookings, and inbox views that align with the seeded data and the template’s business type.

────────────────────
7. TREASURE COAST AI COPY ON DEMO PAGES
────────────────────

On each **template demo page**:

- Add a short section that explains:
  - What Treasure Coast AI is doing for this business type, e.g.:
    - “Treasure Coast AI automatically answers common questions, captures leads, and books tours/consults for [business type].”
  - How this helps the owner:
    - Fewer missed calls.
    - 24/7 lead capture.
    - Centralized dashboard of leads, bookings, and conversations.

Make sure this copy is:
- Clear.
- Non-technical.
- Aligned with the fictional business.

────────────────────
8. CLEANUP & NON-INTERFERENCE WITH REAL CLIENT ACCOUNTS
────────────────────

Important constraints:

- **Demo seeding and demo logic must never touch real client accounts.**

Requirements:
- All demo seed logic (e.g., `demoSeed.ts`) and any reset tools MUST:
  - Operate only on a clearly defined list of **demo workspace IDs**.
  - Never operate on:
    - Canonical `faith_house` workspace used by `demo_faith_house`.
    - Any workspaces created by new real clients via the New Client wizard.

- New client accounts:
  - When a new workspace/client is created via the normal flow, they should:
    - Get the standard “factory default” experience (auto-created bot, automations, etc.) but **no demo seed data**.
    - Be completely unaffected by demo resets.

If you have a demo reset button/endpoint already, update it so:
- It also supports all template demo workspaces.
- It still uses an explicit demo workspace list and never touches non-demo workspaces.

────────────────────
9. FINAL VERIFICATION & DOCS
────────────────────

After implementation:

1) For each template:
   - Visit its `/demo/...` page.
   - Confirm:
     - Page looks polished and informative.
     - Widget loads with correct assistant, brand, **icon**, and greeting.
     - Assistant answers business-specific questions well.
     - Assistant can book the appropriate appointment types.

2) For each template demo workspace:
   - Open the client dashboard (if there is a demo client login).
   - Confirm:
     - Leads, bookings, and conversations look active and realistic.
     - Clicking into leads shows plausible tags and activity.
     - Booking types and statuses make sense.

3) Update `replit.md`:
   - Add a “Template Demos” section that documents:
     - All template types.
     - The corresponding demo workspace for each.
     - The `/demo/...` route for each template.
     - Which workspaces are safe to reset via demo seeding.
     - That demo seeding/reset never touches real client workspaces.
   - Note that demo assistants have **business-appropriate icons/avatars** and where those are configured.

Please keep all changes focused on:
- Demos for all templates.
- Full knowledge bases and Q&A.
- Appointment/booking flows tailored to each business type.
- Business-matching assistant icons.
- Seeded dashboards that are ready to show off to real prospects.
