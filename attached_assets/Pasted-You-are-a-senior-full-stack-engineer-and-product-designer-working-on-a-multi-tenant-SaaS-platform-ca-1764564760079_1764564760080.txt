You are a senior full-stack engineer and product designer working on a multi-tenant SaaS platform called **Treasure Coast AI**.

STACK & CONTEXT
- Tech stack: Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (or similar modern React stack).
- Multi-tenant SaaS:
  - SUPER-ADMIN / AGENCY AREA → for me (the agency owner).
  - CLIENT DASHBOARD → for each business (read-only-ish, simple controls).
- You already have the company vision:

Treasure Coast AI is an agency-first AI assistant platform where:
- I (the agency) create and manage AI assistants for local businesses.
- Clients log in only to view results and basic settings.
- Visitors chat with a widget on the client’s website.

Your job in THIS TASK:
Redesign and fully implement the **SUPER-ADMIN / AGENCY DASHBOARD** so it gives me:
- Total control over clients, bots, data, automations, and integrations.
- A clean, powerful UI to create/edit/manage AI assistants for each client.
- Automatic per-client login + client dashboard when I add a new client.
- Room to grow: no artificial limits on what kinds of assistants I can build.

--------------------------------
HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

1. Super-admin dashboard must be the **central command center**:
   - I can see all clients, all assistants, and high-level stats.
   - I can drill down into any client and any assistant quickly.
   - I can configure everything AI-related at the agency level (models, keys, defaults) and at the assistant level (tone, knowledge, behavior, integrations).

2. Multi-tenant behavior:
   - When I create a new client:
     - A **Client record** is created.
     - A **default “Owner” user account** is created for that client with login credentials.
     - That user is restricted to the **client dashboard** only (no access to super-admin).
   - Each client sees only their own:
     - Assistants/bots
     - Conversations
     - Leads/bookings
     - Analytics
     - Settings

3. No technical clutter for clients:
   - All deep AI settings (API keys, models, system prompts, complex automations) live in the **super-admin** side only.
   - Clients get a simplified dashboard (you already updated that in a separate task).

4. Extreme power for me (super-admin):
   - I should be able to build extremely advanced AI assistants even if clients only see a simple front end.
   - The UI should make it easy to:
     - Clone assistants, use templates, test changes safely, and push updates live.
     - Manage many clients at once.

--------------------------------
INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE — SUPER-ADMIN
--------------------------------

Design the super-admin dashboard with a left sidebar (or top nav) containing at least these main sections:

1) **Home / Command Center**
   - At-a-glance for the whole platform:
     - Total clients
     - Total assistants/bots
     - Total conversations (today, last 7 days, last 30 days)
     - Total leads captured (same ranges)
     - Total bookings (if supported)
     - Error rate / failed responses (if you can detect this)
   - Charts/graphs:
     - Conversations over time
     - Leads over time
     - Top active assistants
   - Quick actions:
     - “Create New Client”
     - “Create New Assistant”
     - “Open Recent Client”
   - This page is for ME only. Make it feel like a pro SaaS control panel.

2) **Clients**
   - Table/list of all clients with:
     - Business Name
     - Primary Contact Name
     - Email
     - Status (Active / Paused / Trial)
     - Number of assistants
     - Current plan
