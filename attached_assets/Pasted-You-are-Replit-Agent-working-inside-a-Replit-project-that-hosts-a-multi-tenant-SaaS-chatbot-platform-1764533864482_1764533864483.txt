You are Replit Agent working inside a Replit project that hosts a multi-tenant SaaS chatbot platform (Treasure Coast AI) used for AI customer service, lead capture, and business automation.

Your job is NOT just to read code. Your job is to:

1. Turn the QA charter below into a concrete, exhaustive test plan.
2. Actually run those tests against the running app (in dev) as far as Replit allows.
3. Log every bug, broken flow, visual glitch, and missing core feature you discover.
4. Immediately fix issues in the codebase (or config) as you find them, without breaking working features.
5. Implement any clearly missing core features that the charter expects but the platform does not yet provide, in a minimal, stable, production-safe way.
6. Re-run tests after changes to verify fixes.
7. Produce a final QA + Fixes report at the end.

Be extremely thorough and careful. Work incrementally. Prefer small, safe changes over massive refactors. Always preserve existing behavior unless it is clearly wrong or broken.

## CONTEXT ABOUT THE APP

- The project is a multi-tenant SaaS chatbot platform with:
  - Super Admin area (workspaces/tenants, users, bots, billing, demos, global settings)
  - Client Admin dashboards (analytics, leads, inbox, automations, bots, widget customization, settings)
  - Public demo hub (/demos) and embedded chat widget for end users
- It is running on Replit, Node/TypeScript/React-style stack.
- We want this platform ready for **real clients**, so both functionality and visual polish matter.

Assume:
- You can start the dev server, open it in the Replit browser, and interact with it.
- You can add/edit tests (e.g., Playwright, Vitest/Jest, or minimal integration tests) IF that helps automate verification.
- You must not introduce breaking changes to core flows that already work unless they’re clearly wrong or insecure.

## YOUR OBJECTIVES

### 1. Build & Execute the Complete Test Plan from the QA Charter

Below is a very detailed QA charter called `[[QA_CHARTER]]`. Treat it as your **master checklist**.

[[QA_CHARTER]]

Your job with this charter:

1. Translate it into concrete test actions inside Replit:
   - Start the dev server.
   - Use the built-in browser to navigate every route and UI section described.
   - Manually click through every clickable element the charter references.
   - For things like “try invalid data”, actually try invalid data.
   - For “different screen sizes”, simulate viewport changes via dev tools or the Replit browser if possible.
   - For cross-role checks, log in as Super Admin, as at least one Client Admin, and as an end user via the widget.
2. Where fully manual testing is too repetitive:
   - If a test framework (like Vitest/Jest/Playwright) is already present, extend it with new tests based on the charter.
   - If there is no test framework and it’s straightforward to add one, you may add a minimal, focused test setup to cover critical pieces (auth, chat endpoint, leads, widget token, automations).

You must attempt to cover:

- Authentication, navigation, login/logout, session handling.
- Super Admin flows: workspaces, users, bots/templates, billing/plan limits.
- Client Admin flows: dashboard overview, analytics, leads, inbox, bot configuration, automations, widget customization.
- End user flows: chat widget behavior, lead capture, error/fallback behavior.
- Demo hub (/demos) and each demo’s chat + CTA flows.
- Data exports (CSV), logs/audit pages (if any).
- Responsive layout and visual polish on different viewport sizes.
- Broken links, 404 handling, direct URL access/bookmarking.
- Basic security/isolation from the UI side (cross-tenant access, role boundaries).
- Basic performance/stress signs (slow pages, heavy operations).
- Accessibility basics (focus, keyboard navigation, labels, color contrast).

### 2. For Every Issue You Find: Fix or Implement Immediately

As you execute the charter, follow this loop:

1. When you hit a bug, missing feature, UX glitch, layout issue, or security concern:
   - Document it in your internal notes with:
     - Title
     - Severity (BLOCKER | MAJOR | MINOR | VISUAL | UX | NICE-TO-HAVE)
     - Role
     - Route / component
     - Steps to reproduce
     - Expected vs actual behavior
     - Any console/network errors
2. Then **fix it immediately** in the codebase, subject to these rules:
   - Keep changes minimal and targeted.
   - Do NOT rip out or refactor large architecture pieces unless absolutely necessary.
   - Preserve valid behavior for other flows; don’t trade one working feature for another.
   - For purely visual issues, update styles/layout to match the charter’s expectations (no overlap, no clipping, good alignment).
   - For validation issues, add or correct validation so bad inputs are rejected gracefully.
   - For missing states (empty states, error messages, spinners), implement them according to the charter.

3. If the charter clearly expects a core feature that is missing entirely (e.g., missing empty state messaging, missing automation toggle, missing bulk action that UI hints at):
   - Implement a reasonable, minimal version of that feature.
   - Hook it into existing data structures, respecting multi-tenant boundaries.
   - Ensure it’s fully wired front-end and back-end as needed.
   - Add basic error handling and UX feedback (toasts, messages).

4. After each non-trivial change:
   - Rebuild / restart the dev server if needed.
   - Re-run the relevant part of the test scenario that failed to confirm the fix.
   - If tests exist, run them. If you added tests, run them too.

If you discover a bug or missing feature that is too large or risky to implement fully in this session (for example, a huge architectural change is required), then:
- Implement the safest possible minimal patch that mitigates the issue (e.g., disable a broken feature or guard against worst behavior).
- Add a clear TODO comment in code describing what needs to be done later.

### 3. Maintain Stability and Multi-Tenant Safety

Throughout your edits:

- Always respect workspace/tenant boundaries. Never allow Client Admin A to see data from Client Admin B.
- Never expose secrets or sensitive information in the browser (no raw tokens, stack traces, etc.).
- Ensure all changes keep the app deployable on Replit with the current structure.
- Avoid introducing heavy dependencies unless absolutely necessary.

### 4. Final Output: QA + Fixes Report

When you are finished:

1. Produce a structured **QA & Fixes Report** that includes:
   - Summary of overall health (e.g. “X blockers, Y majors fixed, Z issues left as TODOs”).
   - List of all **blocker** issues found and what you did to fix them.
   - List of all **major** issues found and fixed.
   - List of any remaining issues that you could not fully address, each with:
     - Severity
     - Location
     - Suggested fix
   - List of key features and flows you validated as working correctly, formatted like:
     - ✅ [Role] [Route/Feature] – brief description.

2. Also summarize any **tests you added or updated** (e.g., new Vitest/Jest/Playwright tests) and how to run them, for example:
   - `npm test`
   - `npm run e2e`
   - or whatever scripts you added/used.

3. Confirm that the project:
   - Still starts in Replit without runtime errors.
   - Still runs its critical flows end-to-end (login → dashboard → chat → lead capture → analytics).

Follow these instructions step-by-step. Use the full QA Charter in [[QA_CHARTER]] as your test blueprint. Be aggressive in finding faults and careful in fixing them so the platform becomes more stable, more polished, and production-ready with each change you make.
