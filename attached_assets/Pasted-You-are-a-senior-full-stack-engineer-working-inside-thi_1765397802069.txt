You are a senior full-stack engineer working inside this Replit project for the Treasure Coast AI SaaS.

IMPORTANT: 
- Previous work already improved multi-tenant isolation and landing page responsiveness. 
- DO NOT modify `requireClientAuth`, `effectiveClientId`, or the landing page (`home.tsx`) unless absolutely necessary.

THIS PROMPT’S GOAL:
Fix and fully wire up:
1) Admin vs client login behavior.
2) Logout for both roles.
3) Route protection for admin and client dashboards.

CREDENTIALS (from product spec):
- SUPER ADMIN:
  - Username: admin
  - Password: admin123
- FAITH HOUSE CLIENT:
  - Username: demo_faith_house
  - Password: demo123

STEP 1 – CLARIFY LOGIN FLOWS
────────────────────
Find the code that handles:
- `/login` (and/or `/admin/login`, `/client/login` if they exist).
- Session/JWT creation and user role detection.
- Redirect after successful login.

REQUIRED BEHAVIOR:
- `admin` / `admin123` → should land on the **super admin / agency dashboard** (multi-workspace view).
- `demo_faith_house` / `demo123` → should land on the **Faith House client workspace dashboard**, NOT the admin area.

Tasks:
1. Make sure the login handler:
   - Identifies user role (super_admin vs client_admin / client_user).
   - Redirects admin to admin dashboard.
   - Redirects client to the correct workspace client dashboard.

2. If you currently have only `/login`:
   - That is OK, but it must branch based on role.
   - Optionally, you can add `/admin/login` and `/client/login` wrappers if clearer, but not required.

3. Implement clear error handling:
   - Wrong username/password → show a friendly error message and do NOT log the user in.

────────────────────
STEP 2 – IMPLEMENT LOGOUT FOR ADMIN AND CLIENT
────────────────────
Right now there is no explicit logout flow in the dashboards.

Tasks:
1. Admin dashboard:
   - Add a visible “Logout” / “Sign out” control (header or sidebar).
   - When clicked, it should:
     - Clear authentication (session, cookie, or token).
     - Redirect to the admin login (or generic `/login` if shared).

2. Client dashboard:
   - Add a visible “Logout” / “Sign out” control.
   - When clicked:
     - Clear client auth.
     - Redirect to client login (or shared `/login`).

Make sure both are implemented in React/Next (or your frontend stack) and wired to actual logout routes on the server.

────────────────────
STEP 3 – PROTECT ROUTES BASED ON ROLE
────────────────────
Use your existing auth middleware to enforce:

- **Admin-only routes** (e.g., `/super-admin`, admin client/workspace management):
  - Must require admin role.
  - If not logged in as admin, redirect to admin login (not 404, not raw JSON).
  
- **Client-only routes** (client dashboards, client leads/bookings/conversations):
  - Must require a client workspace user.
  - If not logged in as client, redirect to client login.

- A client user should NOT be able to access `/super-admin` or admin routes.
- An admin should not accidentally land on some random client dashboard without explicit context.

────────────────────
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
────────────────────
After your changes, the following must hold:

- ✅ Logging in as `admin` / `admin123` takes you to the admin/super-admin dashboard.
- ✅ Logging in as `demo_faith_house` / `demo123` takes you to the Faith House client dashboard.
- ✅ Wrong credentials show clear errors and do not authenticate.
- ✅ Admin dashboard has a working “Logout” that clears auth and redirects to login.
- ✅ Client dashboard has a working “Logout” that clears auth and redirects to login.
- ✅ Protected routes redirect to appropriate login when you are not authenticated or do not have the right role.

Make all necessary code changes to implement this behavior cleanly.
