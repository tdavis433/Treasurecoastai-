You are working inside the Treasure Coast AI SaaS project on Replit.

Goal:
I want the **landing page (home.tsx)** to feel like a polished, high-converting SaaS front page that blows away generic chatbot tools. It should:

- Clearly explain who Treasure Coast AI is for.
- Make the product feel **specialized & superior** for local landlords and small businesses.
- Show clear “before/after” value (lost leads → booked tours & calls).
- Point people strongly toward:
  - Booking a live demo.
  - Trying the interactive demos (/demos, /demo/faith-house).
- Look visually modern, clean, and premium.

Do NOT change:
- Core routes: `/`, `/login`, `/client-login`, `/demos`, `/demo/faith-house`.
- Auth flows or dashboard layouts.

Focus on:
- Copywriting (headlines, subheads, bullets, FAQs).
- Section structure.
- Visual hierarchy and wow factor.

────────────────────
1. HERO SECTION – SHARPER POSITIONING & STRONGER CTAs
────────────────────

Rewrite the hero to be much more specific and compelling.

Requirements:

- Headline (example, feel free to refine wording but keep the idea):
  - “Turn website visitors into booked tours & calls — automatically.”

- Subheadline:
  - Explain in 1–2 sentences that Treasure Coast AI:
    - Gives **local landlords and small businesses** a 24/7 AI front desk.
    - Answers questions, captures leads, and books real appointments without adding staff.

- Primary CTA button:
  - Label: “Book a Live Demo”
  - Scrolls to or opens a contact/demo section, or links to a route if one exists (you choose what fits the current app best).
  - High visual priority.

- Secondary CTA button:
  - Label: “See Interactive Demo”
  - Links to `/demos` (or to `/demo/faith-house` if there’s only one main demo).
  - Slightly less visually loud than primary CTA.

- Keep existing responsive improvements (button stacking, full-width CTAs on mobile, etc.), but update text and hierarchy.

────────────────────
2. SOCIAL PROOF / “WHO IT’S FOR” STRIP
────────────────────

Directly under the hero, add a narrow section that builds trust and clarifies who this is built for.

Examples (adapt to JSX with Tailwind):

- A line like:
  - “Designed for: Sober living homes · Property managers · Local service businesses”

- Optionally, add a subtle “Used and tested with real operators in [region]” line (keep the wording honest and non-fake).

You can include icon chips or simple badges for each audience segment.

────────────────────
3. “HOW IT WORKS” – SIMPLE 3-STEP SECTION
────────────────────

Add a section titled something like:

- “How Treasure Coast AI Works”

Use a 3-step layout (cards or horizontal steps):

1. **Add the widget to your site**
   - “Drop a single script on your website or landing page.”

2. **AI chats and books 24/7**
   - “Visitors get instant answers and can book tours, calls, or appointments in a natural conversation.”

3. **You manage everything in one dashboard**
   - “See every conversation, lead, and booking. Update statuses, add notes, and let us tweak the assistant for you.”

Use icons for each step (widget, chat bubbles, dashboard).

────────────────────
4. FEATURE GRID – FOCUSED ON THEIR PAIN POINTS
────────────────────

Add a feature section highlighting why Treasure Coast AI is better than generic chatbots.

Title ideas:
- “Not just another chatbot”
- “Built for local businesses, not developers”

Include 6–8 feature cards like:

- **24/7 front desk for your website**
  - “Never miss another late-night tour request or consultation inquiry.”

- **Leads → pipeline → bookings**
  - “Every conversation turns into a tracked lead or appointment in your dashboard.”

- **Tours, calls, consults, or any appointment type**
  - “Configure appointment types that match your business: facility tours, phone calls, grooming sessions, consults, and more.”

- **Client dashboard plus agency view**
  - “Your clients get a simple dashboard. You get an agency command center to manage every workspace and assistant.”

- **Deep assistant configuration**
  - “Persona, FAQs, hours, booking logic, and widget branding — all controllable from the editor.”

- **Easy website embed**
  - “Drop one script tag or use the /dev/embed-test page to generate a live preview snippet.”

You can reuse existing icon components or simple SVGs to make the grid look polished.

────────────────────
5. DEMO SHOWROOM SECTION
────────────────────

Show off the templates/demos.

Add a section like:

- Title: “See it working for businesses like yours”
- Subtitle: “Each demo shows a fully configured AI assistant with real lead and booking flows.”

Layout:
- Cards for each main template demo the app supports (at minimum):
  - Faith House (Sober Living)
  - Another local business demo (e.g., Pet Grooming, Med Spa, etc., matching the existing templates in the codebase).

Each card should have:
- Business name: e.g., “Faith House – Sober Living Demo”
- 1–2 line description of the fictional business and what the AI does.
- “Open Demo” button linking to:
  - `/demo/faith-house`
  - `/demo/...` routes for other templates if they exist.

Make the cards visually clickable and consistent with the rest of the design.

────────────────────
6. “WHY TREASURE COAST AI” VS GENERIC TOOLS
────────────────────

Add a comparison-style section that clearly articulates why this platform is superior to generic GPT chat widgets.

Title ideas:
- “Why Treasure Coast AI beats generic chatbots”
- “Purpose-built for real local businesses”

Suggested bullets (rephrase in marketing copy):

- **Purpose-built for tours & appointments**
  - Others: Generic Q&A.
  - Treasure Coast AI: Specifically built to drive bookings, tours, consultations, and phone calls.

- **End-to-end pipeline, not just chat**
  - Others: No tracking of leads.
  - Treasure Coast AI: Leads, bookings, and conversations all show up in dashboards for both admin and clients.

- **Agency & multi-tenant friendly**
  - Others: One-off installs.
  - Treasure Coast AI: Multi-tenant architecture built so an agency can manage many landlords/clients.

- **Done-for-you configuration**
  - Others: Expect you to be a prompt engineer.
  - Treasure Coast AI: You (the agency owner) set up personas, FAQs, and flows so your clients don’t have to touch anything.

Avoid naming competitors directly; just use “generic chatbots” or “DIY AI tools”.

────────────────────
7. FAQ SECTION – ANSWER REAL OWNER OBJECTIONS
────────────────────

Add an FAQ near the bottom with 6–8 questions.

Suggested questions and answers (you can rephrase, but keep the intent):

- “Do I need to be technical to use this?”
  - Answer: No, the agency (me) configures everything; clients just log in to see leads and bookings.

- “Who writes all the questions and answers?”
  - Answer: The assistant comes pre-loaded with a deep knowledge base for the demo, and we customize it for each client’s business.

- “Will this replace my staff?”
  - Answer: It’s designed to handle repetitive questions and after-hours inquiries, so your team can focus on higher-value tasks.

- “Can I see and review every conversation?”
  - Answer: Yes, every message is stored in the client dashboard and in your agency view.

- “What happens if the AI doesn’t know the answer?”
  - Answer: It can gracefully say it’s unsure and capture contact details for a follow-up instead of hallucinating.

- “How hard is it to add to my website?”
  - Answer: Usually just one script tag. If they don’t have a web person, you (the agency owner) can handle it for them.

- “What about my data?”
  - Answer: Brief, honest statement about privacy and not logging full chats in production (match current behavior).

────────────────────
8. FINAL CTA SECTION
────────────────────

End the page with a strong, clean section.

Example:

- Headline:
  - “Ready to stop losing leads after hours?”
- Subtext:
  - “Let an AI front desk greet every visitor, answer their questions, and book their next step — while you focus on running the business.”
- Buttons:
  - Primary: “Book a Live Demo”
  - Secondary: “Watch the Faith House Demo”

Match the hero CTAs for consistency.

────────────────────
9. VISUAL & INTERACTION POLISH
────────────────────

Design & UX polish for `home.tsx`:

- Keep the **existing responsive layout** improvements (hero, buttons, stats).
- Add light **animations** where appropriate (e.g., fade-in or slide-up on scroll for sections, subtle hover states on cards).
- Ensure:
  - No horizontal scrolling at common breakpoints (1440, 1280, 1024, 768, 414).
  - CTAs remain visible and obvious on mobile.
  - Section spacing is generous enough to feel premium but not bloated.

────────────────────
10. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
────────────────────

- Implement all of this in the existing `client/src/pages/home.tsx` (or equivalent home page component).
- Reuse existing Tailwind & component patterns (cards, buttons, sections).
- Don’t break any existing navigation links or auth routes.
- Keep stats or claims that can’t be proven as **generic or clearly “example”**, so I can later plug in real numbers.

When you’re done, please:
- Summarize which sections you added/rewrote.
- Confirm all CTAs still point to the correct routes (`/login`, `/client-login`, `/demos`, `/demo/faith-house`).
