You are working inside the Treasure Coast AI SaaS project.

Goal:
The landing page is already strong (new hero, stats, 9 sections, dark SaaS design, 11 demo workspaces). I do NOT want a full redesign.

I want you to add a few **high-impact, low-risk polish items** to make the marketing story clearer and more compelling for small business owners and landlords:

1) A “Who this is for” strip under the hero  
2) A small “Done-for-you setup” callout  
3) Sharper niche-focused copy in the demo showroom section  
4) A “What you get when you sign up” mini-package list  
5) One light tech flex line about GPT-4, framed as “you don’t touch prompts”

Do not change routing, auth, or demo logic. Only adjust the home/landing page content and structure slightly within the existing visual style.

────────────────────
1. “WHO THIS IS FOR” STRIP (UNDER HERO)
────────────────────

In the landing page file (current home page, likely `client/src/pages/home.tsx`), immediately under the hero section, add a slim section that clearly states the target audiences.

Content (you can adjust exact formatting, but keep the wording close):

- Title line:
  - “Built for local operators who actually need results”

- Substrip (badges or inline list) like:
  - “Sober living homes · Property managers · Home services · Gyms · Restaurants · Med spas”

Use the existing styling system (badges / subtle pill chips) to match the current design.

────────────────────
2. “DONE-FOR-YOU SETUP” CALLOUT
────────────────────

Add a small, visually distinct callout box near either:

- The “How it works” section, or  
- The feature grid section.

Content suggestion:

- Title: “Done-for-you setup”
- Body: “We configure your assistant, knowledge base, and booking flows for you — so you never have to touch prompts, flows, or settings screens.”

Make it a small glassmorphism card that fits the existing dark/neon aesthetic.

────────────────────
3. DEMO SHOWROOM – NICHE-SPECIFIC COPY
────────────────────

In the existing demo showroom section (where you show cards linking to demo workspaces like Faith House, Paws & Suds, Radiance Med Spa, etc.):

- Update the section title and subtitle to something like:

  - Title: “See Treasure Coast AI working for businesses like yours”
  - Subtitle: “Each demo is a fully configured assistant with real lead and booking flows for that niche.”

- For each demo card, add a 1–2 line **niche-specific description**. For example:

  - Faith House Recovery:
    - “AI assistant for sober living: answers intake questions, explains program rules, and books tours or intake calls.”

  - Paws & Suds Grooming:
    - “AI receptionist for grooming studios: handles pricing questions, availability, and fills your grooming calendar.”

  - Radiance Med Spa:
    - “AI coordinator for med spas: explains treatments, sets expectations, and books consultations.”

  - Premier Properties:
    - “AI leasing assistant: responds to showing requests, qualifies renters, and schedules property tours.”

  - Etc., following the same pattern for all 11 demo workspaces.

Ensure all cards remain visually consistent and responsive.

────────────────────
4. “WHAT YOU GET” MINI-PACKAGE SECTION
────────────────────

Before the final CTA (near the bottom), add a concise section titled something like:

- “What you get with Treasure Coast AI”

List 4–6 bullet points, e.g.:

- “One fully configured AI assistant tailored to your business”
- “Website chat widget with your branding, colors, and logo”
- “Client dashboard to view leads, bookings, and conversations”
- “Agency control panel so we can fine-tune everything for you”
- “Ongoing updates to FAQs and flows as your business changes”

Make this a simple, clean list using the existing typography and card styling.

────────────────────
5. LIGHT TECH FLEX LINE (GPT-4) WITHOUT OVERPOWERING THE BENEFITS
────────────────────

Somewhere appropriate (feature grid, comparison section, or near the “Why Treasure Coast AI” copy):

- Add a short line that highlights the technology without making the page feel like it’s only about GPT-4.

Suggested copy:

- “Powered by GPT-4 and tuned specifically for local businesses — but you never have to touch a prompt.”

You can treat this as a small badge, subtext line in the comparison section, or a small one-liner under a feature like “Smarter AI under the hood”.

────────────────────
6. VISUAL INTEGRATION & CHECKS
────────────────────

- Keep the overall **dark luxury + neon-glass** aesthetic.
- Use existing spacing, typography, and Framer Motion patterns where possible to avoid jarring new patterns.
- Verify responsiveness at key breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure:
  - The new strip, callout, and section don’t create horizontal scrolling or cramped layouts.
  - New text doesn’t overflow or clip on small screens.

Do not modify routes, auth, or the demo workspaces. These changes should strictly improve the marketing clarity and perceived value of the landing page.

When you’re done, summarize which sections you modified and confirm that all existing CTAs (login, demos, contact) still work as before.
