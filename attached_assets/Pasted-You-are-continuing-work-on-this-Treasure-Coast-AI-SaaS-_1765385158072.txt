You are continuing work on this Treasure Coast AI SaaS in Replit.

Assume auth/login/logout and route protection are now fixed from the previous block.

GOAL OF THIS BLOCK
────────────────────
Make **Faith House** data consistent between:
- **Client dashboard** (user: `demo_faith_house`).
- **Admin Faith House workspace** (super admin view).

We want a single canonical Faith House workspace whose:
- Leads
- Bookings
- Conversations

all line up between admin and client.

────────────────────
STEP 1 – FIND THE CANONICAL FAITH HOUSE WORKSPACE
────────────────────
Based on current code and DB models:

1. Find where Workspaces/Clients are stored.
2. Find all records that look like Faith House:
   - `faith_house`
   - `faith_house_live`
   - `faith_house_demo`
   - Any “Faith House (Demo)” seed.
3. Find which workspace `demo_faith_house` is actually linked to in the DB.

Define **one canonical Faith House workspace** object that should be used for:
- `demo_faith_house` client login.
- Admin’s Faith House workspace view.
- `/demo/faith-house` public demo (if applicable).

If duplicates exist:
- Either migrate any relevant data into the canonical workspace.
- Or mark them as deprecated and hide from normal admin lists.

────────────────────
STEP 2 – WIRE ADMIN VIEW TO THIS WORKSPACE
────────────────────
Fix the super admin “Clients / Workspaces” UI so that:

- The Faith House card opens the **canonical Faith House workspace** route.
- In that workspace:
  - Overview metrics show counts of leads/bookings/conversations for that canonical workspace.
  - Leads tab lists all leads associated with that workspace.
  - Bookings tab lists all bookings for that workspace.
  - Conversations tab (if present) shows the same conversations that the client sees.

Ensure all these queries are filtered by the workspace’s primary key (id/slug).

────────────────────
STEP 3 – MATCH CLIENT VS ADMIN DATA
────────────────────
Ensure that for the canonical Faith House workspace:

- The **client dashboard** for `demo_faith_house`:
  - Shows the same counts (total leads, total bookings, conversations) as admin’s workspace overview.
  - Leads table and bookings table show the same rows.

- Changes propagate:
  - If an admin updates a Faith House lead’s status (e.g., New → Contacted), the client view shows the same status after reload.
  - If an admin updates booking status (e.g., Pending → Confirmed), the client view matches.

Focus on **data correctness**, not styling.

────────────────────
STEP 4 – /demo/faith-house PUBLIC PAGE
────────────────────
Check how `/demo/faith-house` is connected:

- It should use the **same assistant / workspace** as the canonical Faith House workspace OR an intentionally separate “demo safe copy”.
- If it’s separate, make that explicit in code comments and ensure admin/client dashboards you care about point to the canonical one.

If possible, make `/demo/faith-house` use the canonical Faith House assistant so conversations there also show up under that workspace’s conversations/leads.

────────────────────
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR THIS BLOCK
────────────────────
- ✅ There is one clearly defined canonical Faith House workspace in the code.
- ✅ `demo_faith_house` client dashboard uses that workspace.
- ✅ Admin Faith House workspace view uses that workspace.
- ✅ Leads, bookings and conversations for Faith House match between admin and client.
- ✅ Status changes made as admin are visible in client dashboard and persist.

Make the code changes now. Document any intentionally separate Faith House demo workspace with comments if you must keep more than one.
