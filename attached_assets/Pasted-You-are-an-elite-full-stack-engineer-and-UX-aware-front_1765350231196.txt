You are an elite full-stack engineer and UX-aware front-end dev.

You are working on the Treasure Coast AI platform in this Replit project.

CONTEXT – ALREADY DONE (DO NOT BREAK THESE):

• Phase 1:
  – Faith House demo chatbot at /demo/faith-house can successfully capture at least one lead + booking.
  – OpenAI rate limit errors are now handled with a friendly chat response instead of an ugly red error toast.

• Phase 2:
  – Admin and client analytics for the Faith House workspace are in sync (same leads, bookings, messages, conversations).
  – The Create Login feature in the Faith House workspace Users tab works:
      * API returns 201.
      * User is created in the DB.
      * Success toast appears.
  – “View as Client” from the Faith House workspace works:
      * Impersonation modifies the session correctly.
      * Client dashboard opens and shows what the client sees.

DO NOT undo or break any of that behavior.

NOW FOCUS ON TWO THINGS ONLY:

  1) Assistant creation wizard (super-admin) – scroll / completion UX.
  2) Chat send vs reset UX on the public + Faith House chat widgets.

OBJECTIVE 1 – FIX ASSISTANT CREATION WIZARD SCROLL / COMPLETION
────────────────────────

Current issue (from prior QA):

• As super-admin:
  – Go to Assistants / All Assistants.
  – Click “New Assistant” (or similar).
  – Step 1 of the wizard works.
  – Step 2 uses a tall modal:
      * Content extends below the viewport on a laptop.
      * Scrolling often affects the PAGE behind the modal instead of the modal content.
      * It is difficult or impossible to reach the “Next” / “Finish” buttons.
  – Result: You cannot reliably complete the wizard.

Required behavior:

• On a typical laptop viewport:
  – The wizard must be fully usable; you must be able to:
      * Read all the fields.
      * Scroll inside the modal or panel if needed.
      * Always reach the action buttons (Next / Finish).
  – The background page should NOT scroll while the modal is active.

Your task:

1. Find the component(s) that implement the assistant creation wizard UI.
2. Fix the layout & scroll behavior so that:
   • The modal (or panel) has a max-height tied to the viewport and scrolls internally
     (e.g., `max-height: 100vh - somePadding` with `overflow-y: auto` on the content area).
   • Body scroll is prevented or locked while the modal is open.
   • On a normal laptop screen, the “Next” / “Finish” buttons are always reachable by scrolling the modal.

3. Manually verify:
   • As admin, you can complete ALL steps of the wizard.
   • You can successfully create a brand new assistant end-to-end.
   • No obvious visual regressions on large desktop screens.

OBJECTIVE 2 – CLEAN UP CHAT SEND vs RESET UX (PUBLIC + FAITH HOUSE)
────────────────────────

Current UX problems (from prior QA):

• In the public chat widget (on `/`) and in the Faith House demo chat (`/demo/faith-house`):
  – There appear to be two arrow-like controls near the input:
      * O*
