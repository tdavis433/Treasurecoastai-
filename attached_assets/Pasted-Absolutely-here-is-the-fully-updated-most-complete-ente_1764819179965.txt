🔧 TREASURE COAST AI — FULL E2E SIMULATION + INTEGRATION TESTING (NO CODE/DB MANIPULATION)

Ultimate Pre-Launch Readiness Prompt — From Landing Page → Lead → Workspace → Bot → Widget → Integrations → Dashboards

You are testing the Treasure Coast AI AI assistant platform.

Your mission:
Simulate a real business owner discovering Treasure Coast AI → submitting interest → being onboarded → receiving their new AI assistant → embedding it on their site → seeing everything work.

You must test:
	•	AI assistant
	•	Booking flow
	•	Widget appearance editor
	•	Automations
	•	Dashboard analytics
	•	Conversation logging
	•	Lead capture
	•	“Needs Review” system
	•	Multi-tenant isolation
	•	All integrations (webhooks, email notifications, SMS triggers, booking tracking, etc.)
	•	Widget reactions to automations, appearance settings, booking events
	•	Zero backend manipulation

⚠️ NO: modifying code, editing the DB, running scripts, calling APIs manually
⚠️ ONLY: Landing page → admin UI → client UI → widget → browser interactions

If the UI cannot perform something required, mark it as a product gap.
