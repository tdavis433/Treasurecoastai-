You are continuing work on the Treasure Coast AI SaaS in this Replit project.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT touch multi-tenant isolation, login/logout, or Faith House mappings (these are already correct).
- Assistant configuration, widget embed, and error handling have been improved already; keep what’s working.
- Billing/Stripe can remain a “Set Up Subscription” placeholder for now.

THIS PROMPT’S GOAL:
Implement **deeper automations that make onboarding a new client smoother** and make it easy to go from:
- “New workspace created” → 
- “Assistant configured enough” → 
- “Widget ready to embed on their website”

without a ton of manual steps.

Concretely:
1) Auto-create a default assistant when a new workspace/client is created.
2) Pre-populate that assistant with sensible starter settings (persona + FAQs).
3) Ensure the embed snippet is immediately usable.
4) Provide a couple of default system automations that act on new leads/bookings.

────────────────────
1. AUTO-CREATE DEFAULT ASSISTANT FOR NEW WORKSPACE
────────────────────
When a new client/workspace is created via the **New Client / New Workspace wizard**:

1) After successful workspace creation:
   - Check if the workspace has any assistants/bots.
   - If none:
     - Automatically create a **default assistant** for this workspace.

2) Default assistant properties:
   - Name: e.g., `${BusinessName} AI Assistant` (fallback to “New Business AI Assistant” if name missing).
   - Status: Enabled/Active by default.
   - Default persona/system prompt:
     - Generic but solid template, e.g.:
       - “You are an AI assistant for [Business Name], a local service business. You answer questions, collect contact info, and encourage visitors to book a call or visit.”

3) Link to workspace:
   - Ensure the new assistant is properly linked to the workspace’s clientId/tenant id.

Update `demoSeed.ts` or equivalent seed logic to document this behavior and ensure it plays nicely with Faith House (do NOT break existing seeds).

────────────────────
2. STARTER KNOWLEDGE & FAQ TEMPLATE
────────────────────
For the default assistant created above:

1) Pre-populate **Knowledge/Business Profile** with generic placeholders:
   - Business Name: workspace’s name.
   - Business Type: “Local service business” (or similar generic label).
   - Contact email: workspace’s contact email (if set).
   - Phone: empty placeholder to be filled by client.

2) Pre-populate **FAQs** with customizable templates, e.g.:
   - “What services do you offer?”
   - “What are your hours?”
   - “How can I contact you?”
   - Each answer should include placeholders like “[Your services here]” so the client knows what to edit.

3) Make sure:
   - These prefilled values appear in the assistant’s Knowledge/FAQ UI right after workspace creation.
   - They can be easily edited and saved by admin or client.

────────────────────
3. WIDGET EMBED READY OUT-OF-THE-BOX
────────────────────
For the default assistant:

1) Ensure that the **Channels & Widget** tab:
   - Immediately has a valid embed snippet using:
     - `data-client-id` = this workspace id.
     - `data-bot-id` = this default assistant id.
   - There should be nothing the user MUST configure before the snippet works.

2) UX:
   - In the workspace details (or somewhere obvious), surface a link/button:
     - e.g., “Get Embed Code” that jumps directly to this assistant’s Channels & Widget tab for convenience.
   - This is especially helpful during onboarding calls.

3) Documentation:
   - Update `replit.md` with a short “Onboarding Flow” section:
     - Explaining that after creating a new client, there is automatically:
       - A default assistant.
       - Basic FAQs.
       - A ready-to-copy widget snippet.

────────────────────
4. DEFAULT AUTOMATIONS FOR NEW LEADS & BOOKINGS
────────────────────
Use the existing Automations system (already present with a tab and workflow manager) to provide **sensible default automations** for each new workspace:

1) On workspace creation:
   - Create default automation workflows for that workspace, such as:

   a) “New Lead – Tag & Status”
      - Trigger: Lead created.
      - Actions:
        - Set lead status to “New”.
        - Add a tag like “inbound”.
        - Optionally, log an internal note like “Lead auto-tagged by default workflow.”

   b) “New Booking – Default Status”
      - Trigger: Booking created.
      - Actions:
        - Set booking status to “Pending”.
        - Optionally, add a note “Booking created from AI assistant.”

2) Notifications (lightweight):
   - If you already have a notification/logging mechanism:
     - Add an action that writes to a workspace-level Notification/Activity log when:
       - A new lead is created.
       - A new booking is created.
   - If you *don’t* have a notification system yet:
     - At least create an internal “Automation Log” entry per workspace so admins can see that automations fired.

3) Automations UI:
   - In the assistant/workspace Automations tab:
     - Show these default workflows as **enabled**.
     - Allow toggling them on/off.
     - Make sure turning them off stops them from firing.

────────────────────
5. QA & CONSISTENCY
────────────────────
After implementing the above:

1) Simulate creating a new workspace via the New Client wizard:
   - Verify:
     - Default assistant is created.
     - Knowledge/FAQs are pre-populated.
     - Widget embed snippet is immediately available and copyable.
     - Default automations appear in the Automations tab as active.

2) Manually create:
   - A test lead for that workspace (via existing UI or seed/demo tools).
   - A test booking.
   - Confirm:
     - Lead gets status/tag set by the default automation.
     - Booking gets status set.
     - Any logs/notifications you implemented show entries that these automations fired.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
────────────────────
- ✅ Creating a new workspace auto-creates a default assistant linked to that workspace.
- ✅ The default assistant has:
  - Reasonable generic persona.
  - Pre-populated FAQ/knowledge placeholders that are editable.
- ✅ For that assistant:
  - Channels & Widget tab exposes a working embed snippet with correct `data-client-id` and `data-bot-id`.
  - A “Get Embed Code” path from workspace overview quickly gets you there.
- ✅ Each new workspace has default automations:
  - “New Lead – Tag & Status”
  - “New Booking – Default Status”
- ✅ When leads/bookings are created for that workspace:
  - Default automations fire and update status/tags/logs as designed.
- ✅ `replit.md` documents the onboarding flow and default automations clearly.

Implement these changes now.
