You are a senior full-stack engineer working on a multi-tenant SaaS platform called **Treasure Coast AI**.

STACK & CONTEXT
- Tech stack: Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind (or similar modern React stack).
- There are TWO main areas:
  1. SUPER-ADMIN / AGENCY AREA (for us, the agency) → DO NOT CHANGE in this task.
  2. CLIENT DASHBOARD (for each business owner) → THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE UPGRADING NOW.

HIGH-LEVEL GOAL
Completely review and upgrade the **client dashboard** so it:
- Feels clean, modern, and beautiful.
- Shows stats that ACTUALLY matter to the business owner.
- Lets them change basic “front-of-house” things (general settings) without breaking anything.
- Hides or removes all “developer” / “backend” style controls. We handle all heavy logic behind the scenes.

TREAT THE CLIENT AS:
- A busy small business owner (restaurant, barber, sober living, gym, etc.).
- Not technical.
- Wants quick clarity: “Is this working?” “How many leads/bookings did I get?” “What do I need to change?”

YOUR TASKS (BIG PICTURE)
1. Go through every page, tab, and component of the **client dashboard**, and:
   - Remove or hide anything that’s confusing, technical, or only relevant to us (the agency).
   - Rename and reorganize things so it’s crystal clear for a non-technical business owner.
   - Add or adjust features so they can:
     - See key performance stats.
     - View and search conversations/leads.
     - Make simple, safe changes.

2. Make the UI consistent with a **clean, premium SaaS**:
   - Simple layout.
   - Clear spacing and typography.
   - Logical grouping of information.
   - Use existing design system / tailwind classes already in the project (dark / neon / coastal if present).

3. Implement all changes directly in code:
   - Update components, pages, hooks, API calls.
   - Clean up unused code and dead tabs.
   - Add comments where logic might need future expansion.

DETAIL SPEC — CLIENT DASHBOARD UX
--------------------------------

The client dashboard should be built around these main sections in the sidebar/top nav:

1) **Overview**
   - Purpose: At-a-glance health of their assistant.
   - Show:
     - Total conversations (Today, Last 7 days, Last 30 days).
     - Leads captured (with contact info) for the same ranges.
     - Booked appointments / calls (if that exists in the system).
     - Online/offline status of their assistant (e.g. “Assistant is ACTIVE / PAUSED”).
     - Basic satisfaction / success metric if available (e.g. % of conversations that reached a goal).
   - Add simple cards / widgets with clear labels, like:
     - “New Leads (Last 7 Days)”
     - “Total Conversations (Last 30 Days)”
     - “Bookings from Assistant (Last 30 Days)”
   - Include a short, friendly text at the top like:
     - “Here’s how your AI assistant has been helping your business.”

2) **Conversations**
   - Purpose: Let the client see what the bot is saying and what customers ask.
   - Features:
     - List of conversations with:
       - Customer name (if captured) or “Visitor”.
       - Timestamp of last message.
       - Basic tags/status (e.g. “Lead captured”, “Booking made”, “General question”).
     - Ability to click a conversation to view the full chat transcript.
     - Optional: simple filters (Date range, conversation type).
   - Do NOT add heavy helpdesk features (assignments, complex tagging, etc.). Keep it simple and readable.

3) **Leads / Contacts**
   - Purpose: Show captured leads in a simple table.
   - Columns (as available in the data model):
     - Name
     - Phone
     - Email
     - Source (e.g. “Website chat widget”)
     - Date captured
   - Allow:
     - Simple search by name/email/phone.
     - Export to CSV if easy (optional, but nice).
   - Make it easy for the client to see “real people” the assistant has brought in.

4) **Bookings / Appointments** (only if the product already supports this)
   - If the system already tracks bookings, show:
     - Date/time
     - Service type
     - Customer name + contact
     - Status (upcoming / completed / canceled)
   - If there’s no real bookings feature, either:
     - Hide this tab entirely, OR
     - Rename it to something accurate that matches existing functionality.

5) **Knowledge Base / FAQs**
   - Purpose: Let the client safely help the assistant answer better.
   - Show:
     - A list/table of FAQ entries:
       - Question
       - Answer
       - Category (if used)
     - Buttons: “Add Question”, “Edit”, “Delete”.
   - Make the edit form extremely simple:
     - “Customer Question”
     - “Your Answer”
   - Do NOT expose any deep prompt engineering or internal system prompts here.
   - If the project already has a way to sync this to the bot, hook into it. If not, wire it up to the existing schema/endpoints used by the bot.

6) **Settings**
   - This is where the client can change “general stuff” safely.
   - Group settings into clear sections:

   [Business Info]
   - Business Name
   - Address (optional)
   - Phone
   - Email
   - Website
   - Hours of operation

   [Assistant Basics]
   - Assistant / Bot name (e.g. “Faith House Assistant”).
   - Welcome message / greeting.
   - Default tone: dropdown if supported (e.g. “Friendly”, “Professional”, “Casual”) — optional.

   [Availability & Status]
   - Simple toggle: ACTIVE / PAUSED for their assistant.
   - Text helper: explain what PAUSED means (e.g. “The assistant will stop replying to new conversations.”).
   - IMPORTANT: Call whatever existing API / field controls bot status (respect any existing status logic).

   [Notifications]
   - Simple toggles:
     - “Email me new leads”
     - “Email me daily summary” (if implemented)
   - If emailing is not yet implemented, either:
     - Hide these options, or
     - Add them but clearly mark as “coming soon” (only if you also add TODO comments in code).

   [Chat Widget]
   - If a website widget already exists in the project:
     - Show the script snippet they should copy/paste into their site.
     - Allow changing:
       - Primary color (within a safe set if needed).
       - Position (bottom-right / bottom-left).
       - Widget greeting text.
   - Hide any tailwind/theme internals; only expose simple, client-friendly options.

7) **Billing / Plan** (ONLY if already partially implemented)
   - If Stripe or billing exists:
     - Show current plan name.
     - Price per month.
     - Next billing date.
     - Button: “Manage Subscription” that links to the Stripe portal or billing page.
   - If billing is not fully wired up, either:
     - Hide this tab completely, OR
     - Show read-only info with a TODO in the code for future Stripe integration.

--------------------------------
CLEANUP & RENAMING
--------------------------------

Go through the current client dashboard pages and:

- Rename any confusing tabs:
  - Example:
    - “Bot Config” → “Assistant Settings”
    - “KB Entries” → “Knowledge Base”
    - “Logs” → “Conversations” or remove if it’s raw technical logs.
- Remove / hide:
  - API key fields.
  - Model names.
  - Temperature / top_p / system prompt blocks.
  - Internal feature flags.
- Replace technical copy with simple explanations:
  - “LLM Provider” → HIDDEN or handled by super-admin only.
  - “Embedding Sync” → HIDDEN or described as “We keep your assistant updated automatically.”

--------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
--------------------------------

1) DISCOVER EXISTING STRUCTURE
   - Find all client dashboard routes/pages (e.g. /client, /dashboard, /app/client, etc.).
   - List the current sections and components.
   - Identify which ones are:
     - Client-friendly and useful.
     - Too technical and should be moved/removed/hidden.

2) DESIGN NEW NAV STRUCTURE IN CODE
   - Implement a clear navigation based on:
     - Overview
     - Conversations
     - Leads
     - Bookings (if real)
     - Knowledge Base
     - Settings
     - Billing (if real)
   - Update routing, layout components, and active state handling as needed.

3) IMPLEMENT UI + LOGIC CHANGES
   - Build / refactor pages for each section above.
   - Use existing design tokens/components where possible (e.g. Card, Table, Badge, Toggle, etc.).
   - Wire each page to the existing backend API / DB queries.
   - Add new aggregations for metrics in Overview if needed (e.g. use existing conversations/leads tables).

4) CLEAN & COMMENT
   - Remove dead code, unused components, commented-out experiments.
   - Add comments in code where future work will be needed:
     - e.g. // TODO: Wire this “Daily Summary Email” toggle to real email service.
   - Ensure TypeScript types stay accurate and strict.

5) FINAL PASS
   - Click through the entire client dashboard experience as if you are a non-technical owner.
   - Confirm:
     - All labels are clear.
     - No technical jargon is visible.
     - Important stats are obvious.
     - General settings are easy to adjust.
   - Fix any layout or wording issues you see.

CONSTRAINTS
- DO NOT modify the super-admin / agency control center in this task.
- DO NOT expose raw prompts, API keys, model names, or low-level AI settings to the client.
- Preserve all security and auth rules already in place.
- Keep code clean, typed, and production-ready.
