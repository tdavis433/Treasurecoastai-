Do this like QA. If something doesn’t behave like I describe, tell me exactly what happened.

🧪 A. Control Center

Log in as super-admin.

Go to whatever route shows the new view (probably /super-admin or /super-admin/control-center).

Confirm:

Left side shows all clients (Faith House + demo).

Clicking a client shows its bots.

Each bot has:

Name

Status badge

“Edit Bot Settings” button

“Open Demo” (for demo bots)

If any of that is missing or janky, screenshot it and send it.

🧪 B. Status Enforcement

Pick one demo client first so you don’t mess with Faith House.

In Control Center:

Pick the demo client.

Toggle status → PAUSED.

Open that client’s chat (demo page or widget).

Try sending a message.

✅ Expected:

You get a clear “service is paused” style message.

No real AI reply.

Try logging into that client’s admin / dashboard if that exists.

If there’s logic there yet, it should either:

Block access

Or at least show paused status clearly

Then:

Toggle back to ACTIVE.

Send a message again.

✅ Expected:

Bot works normally again.

If that works → your pause system is legit.

🧪 C. Bot Editing (this is your “full control” test)

In Control Center:

Pick a demo bot (e.g. Restaurant).

Click Edit Bot Settings.

In the form:

Change Business Name to something obvious like:

“TEST — Coastal Breeze Grill”

Change Phone to a fake number

Change one FAQ answer to add [TEST] somewhere.

Save.

Now:

Either open the demo page for that bot

Or send a question that would trigger that FAQ.

✅ Expected:

Bot’s language now uses the new business name.

The FAQ answer should reflect [TEST].

If that works → you officially have UI-driven bot config, no JSON needed.

🧪 D. Stripe Billing (use test mode)

Only do this once your .env is set with Stripe test keys.

Add:

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (test key)

STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

STRIPE_PRICE_ID (test subscription price)

FRONTEND_URL (http://localhost:port
 for now)

Restart the server.

In Control Center:

On a client view, find the Subscribe / Billing / Start Subscription button (whatever Replit labeled it).

Click it.

✅ Expected:

Browser redirects you to a Stripe Checkout page.

Complete checkout with Stripe test card:

Use 4242 4242 4242 4242 etc.

After success:

Confirm the client’s status flips to ACTIVE (if it wasn’t already).

Try pausing in Stripe (cancel subscription / simulate failure) and make sure webhook drives status → PAUSED.

If that loop works → your SaaS is truly subscription-driven.
