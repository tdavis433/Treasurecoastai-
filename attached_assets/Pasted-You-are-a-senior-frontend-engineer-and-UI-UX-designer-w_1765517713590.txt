You are a senior frontend engineer and UI/UX designer working on the Treasure Coast AI platform in this Replit project.

In the repo there is a file called `report.md` titled **“Treasure Coast AI Platform – Visual Design & UX Audit.”**  
Treat that file as the source-of-truth design spec.

Your job:
Use the recommendations in `report.md` to refactor and upgrade ALL visuals in the project (landing page, demo pages, client dashboards, and admin dashboard) so the product matches that spec and feels like a top-tier SaaS app (Stripe / Linear / Notion / Intercom level polish).

### How to work with `report.md`

1. Open `report.md` and read it fully.
2. Note its structure:
   - High-Level First Impression
   - Page-by-Page / Area-by-Area Review
     - Landing Page (Home)
     - Demo Overview / All Demos
     - Individual Demo Pages & Chat Widget
     - Client Dashboards
     - Admin / Super Admin
   - Global Visual Design Recommendations
   - Customer-Perspective Attractiveness Upgrades
   - Prioritized Action List (Quick Wins / Medium Lifts / Later)

3. Use those sections as your implementation checklist:
   - For each page/area in the codebase, apply the corresponding bullets under:
     - “Visual issues / inconsistencies”
     - “UX friction or confusion points”
     - “Specific improvements I recommend”
   - Then apply the “Global Visual Design Recommendations” and spacing/consistency rules across shared components.

### Implementation requirements

**A. Central design system**

- Create or update a shared theme / design system:
  - Define color tokens (primary, accent, background, surface, border, text-main, text-muted, success, warning, error) following the coastal / dark theme described in `report.md`.
  - Define typography scale (H1–H4, body, small, caption) with consistent sizes, line heights, and weights.
  - Define a spacing scale (e.g. 4/8/12/16/24/32/40/64px) and use it for section padding, card padding, and gaps.
  - Standardize border radiuses and shadows for cards, modals, nav bars, and buttons.
- Replace scattered inline styles / random hex colors with these tokens.
- Ensure landing, demos, dashboards, and admin all consume the same design tokens and components.

**B. Buttons & CTAs**

- Implement a reusable Button component or classes for:
  - Primary CTA
  - Secondary
  - Tertiary / ghost
- Base the styling and states on the “Global visual design recommendations” and “Quick wins” in `report.md`:
  - Same height, padding, radius, and typography everywhere.
  - Consistent hover/focus/active states with subtle transitions.
- Replace all ad-hoc buttons on:
  - Hero sections, demo cards, “Book Demo” / “Try this Demo”
  - Client login, dashboards, and admin actions.

**C. Layout, spacing, and alignment**

- Using the detailed notes in each page’s section of `report.md`, adjust:
  - Grid structure (consistent column widths, card sizes).
  - Vertical rhythm (consistent spacing between sections and components).
  - Alignment of icons, text baselines, and badges so nothing looks “off by a few pixels.”
- Fix every spacing/alignment issue called out in `report.md`:
  - Landing page sections
  - Demo grid and demo detail pages
  - Dashboard cards, tables, and filters
  - Admin client list and overview cards

**D. Typography**

- Apply the hierarchy described in `report.md`:
  - H1 for main page titles (e.g. hero headings).
  - H2/H3 for section titles.
  - Body text and muted helper text for labels, captions, and secondary info.
- Ensure tables, metrics, and chat messages use readable sizes and weights.
- Fix any inconsistent font usage that `report.md` mentions.

**E. Demos & chat widget**

- For each demo page mentioned in `report.md`:
  - Apply the recommended hero layout, card styling, and tags/chips styling.
- Update the embedded chat widget styling so it:
  - Uses the same color tokens, border radius, and typography as the rest of the app.
  - Fixes any contrast or spacing issues the audit calls out.

**F. Dashboards & admin**

- Implement the specific dashboard improvements listed in `report.md`:
  - Consistent KPI card design (numbers, labels, icons).
  - Cleaner tables with consistent header styles and row spacing.
  - Standardized tags/badges for statuses (“Active”, plans, etc.).
- Apply the admin-specific suggestions (e.g., client list cards, “Needs Your Review” section).

**G. Responsiveness**

- Use the mobile/responsive recommendations in `report.md` to:
  - Fix any layout issues on small screens (overflows, cramped sections).
  - Ensure CTAs and nav elements are tappable and well-spaced.

**H. Respect functionality**

- Do **not** change business logic, data fetching, or routing.
- Only adjust JSX/HTML/CSS/Tailwind/layout and small structural changes needed for design.

When you’re done, the UI should visually match the intent and concrete recommendations in `report.md`. Make sure the final result feels unified, premium, and clearly more polished than a generic SaaS template.
