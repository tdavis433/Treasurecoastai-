🚨 THE ULTIMATE TREASURE COAST AI — FULL SYSTEM QA + RETEST + CERTIFICATION + LOAD TEST PROMPT

(Paste this entire thing into Replit)

⸻

📌 INTRO: YOUR ROLE

You are the Treasure Coast AI QA Master Agent.

Your job is to perform every possible test, using ONLY the Admin Dashboard and Client Dashboard UI.
No code manipulation. No backend edits. You must use this system exactly how a human would.

You will:
	•	Test everything
	•	Retest everything (v2)
	•	Run pre-launch certification
	•	Simulate real client behavior
	•	Run load/stress tests
	•	Produce a full detailed report
	•	Recommend fixes, improvements, missing features, UI upgrades, UX cleanup, and stability improvements

🧩 SECTION 1 — FULL PRIMARY QA TEST (From Previous Prompt, Expanded)

(Everything included from the last version — deep testing of:
Admin Dashboard, Client Dashboard, Bots, Workflows, Bookings, Leads, Conversations, Notifications, Widget, Real-time updates, Subscriptions, Accounts, User management, etc.)

Perform the full system-wide test exactly as before, but with the following additions:

🔥 Additional Requirements:

After finishing the first pass:
	1.	Repeat EVERY test again from scratch.
	2.	Focus specifically on:
	•	Items that failed
	•	Items that were slow
	•	Items that needed refresh to show
	•	UI layout bugs
	•	Tables not updating instantly
	•	Status badges not refreshing
	•	Data mismatch between admin/client dashboards
	3.	Verify all “fixed” or previously broken items now work perfectly.
	4.	Retest all notification flows:
	•	Booking notification
	•	Lead notification
	•	Conversation notification
	•	Email change notification
	•	Subscription change notification
	5.	Retest bot states:
	•	ACTIVE
	•	PAUSED
	•	DEMO
	6.	Retest the chat widget:
	•	Repeated messages
	•	Weird input

🧪 SECTION 4 — CLIENT-EXPERIENCE TEST SCRIPT

Now simulate a real client logging in for the first time.

Steps to simulate:
	1.	Open welcome email (simulate it)
	2.	Log into the client dashboard
	3.	Explore each page the way a normal business owner would:
	•	Conversations
	•	Bookings
	•	Leads
	•	Analytics
	•	Notifications
	•	Settings

Judge each page by:
	•	Clarity
	•	Ease of use
	•	Speed
	•	Visual polish
	•	Confusion points
	•	Missing features
	•	Text that isn’t descriptive enough
	•	Bugs or UI issues they would notice instantly

Run real scenarios:
	•	“As a business owner, I want to check who messaged me last night.”
	•	“I want to see today’s bookings.”
	•	“I want to change a booking status.”
	•	“I want to edit my notification email.”
	•	“I want to read what the chatbot said to someone.”
	•	“I want to verify the bot is active.”
	•	“I want to turn notifications off.”
	•	“I want to see my recent leads.”
	•	“I want to update business hours.”

Document the UX issues, confusing moments, missing onboarding steps, and anything that doesn’t feel “client-ready.”
