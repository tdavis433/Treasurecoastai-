Alright, this is actually perfect – Replit’s phase list is solid, it just needs to be rewired to match your real vision:
	•	YOU = agency owner + builder
	•	CLIENTS = can only view stuff (leads, chats, bookings, basic analytics)
	•	Platform = simple, clean, focused on AI assistants for local businesses (not some mega “build your own AI platform” thing)

Here’s a single master prompt that:
	•	Uses Replit’s 8 phases
	•	Adds way more detail to each
	•	Bakes in everything we talked about:
	•	You build and edit the assistants
	•	Clients get a simple dashboard
	•	Bots show bookings/leads/conversations/analytics
	•	No wild self-service app builder for clients

Just copy everything between the lines into Replit Agent:

🔥 MASTER REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — TREASURE COAST AI (AGENCY MODEL)

You are building Treasure Coast AI, an agency-first AI assistant platform.

Core idea (read carefully):
	•	I am the agency owner.
	•	I log into an admin panel and build AI assistants for different businesses.
	•	Each business gets a client dashboard where they can view:
	•	Conversations
	•	Leads
	•	Bookings/appointments
	•	Simple analytics
	•	Clients do NOT build bots. They only see results.
	•	The goal is simple, stable, beautiful, not a bloated Intercom clone.

Use the following PHASES as your roadmap.
Do not go outside this scope.

⸻

PHASE 1 — Clean Slate: Remove the Bloat

Goal: Strip the project down to ONLY what is needed for this vision.
	1.	Remove or disable:
	•	Any “build your own AI app” features.
	•	Any fully self-service “prompt marketplace” / “program-your-own-tool” style systems.
	•	Any huge generic workflow engines that aren’t needed for:
	•	Admin bot configuration
	•	Simple client viewing
	2.	Keep (or create minimal structure for):
	•	A Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + Prisma project.
	•	An admin area where I manage bots & clients.
	•	A client area where business owners log in to view their data.
	•	A reusable embeddable chat widget.
	3.	Ensure the project:
	•	Compiles cleanly.
	•	Has no TypeScript or lint errors.
	•	Has a simple, clean folder structure.

⸻

PHASE 2 — Data Foundation

Goal: Define a clean database schema to support the agency model.

Create Prisma models (or equivalent) for at least:
	•	User
	•	id, email, name, role ("AGENCY_ADMIN" or "CLIENT_USER")
	•	ClientBusiness
	•	The business the bot serves (name, industry, domain, contact info, timezone, status)
	•	Bot
	•	Linked to a ClientBusiness
	•	name, status, primaryPurpose, welcomeMessage
	•	instructions (system prompt)
	•	reference to knowledge / scraped data
	•	BotFAQ
	•	Linked to Bot
	•	question, answer
	•	KnowledgeSource
	•	For website scrape, uploaded docs, manual content
	•	type ("SCRAPED_URL" | "MANUAL" | "FILE"), url, title, status
	•	Conversation
	•	Linked to Bot, optionally Lead
	•	startedAt, endedAt, source ("WIDGET"), summary, intent, createdFromPageUrl
	•	Message
	•	Linked to Conversation
	•	senderType ("USER" | "BOT"), text, timestamp, meta
	•	Lead
	•	Linked to ClientBusiness and optionally Conversation
	•	name, email, phone, source, status ("NEW" | "CONTACTED" | "BOOKED" | "LOST"), notes
	•	Booking
	•	Linked to ClientBusiness and optionally Conversation + Lead
	•	dateTime, serviceType, status, externalCalendarLink
	•	AnalyticsDailySnapshot (optional for later)
	•	For caching daily metrics per bot/business (conversations, leads, bookings, etc.)

Requirements:
	•	Every record is clearly scoped to a ClientBusiness.
	•	User with role "AGENCY_ADMIN" can see all businesses.
	•	User with role "CLIENT_USER" can only see their own ClientBusiness.

Run migrations and ensure database schema is valid.

PHASE 3 — Website Scraper & AI Enrichment (Admin Only)

Goal: Give me, the admin, a fast way to feed business knowledge into each bot.

In the admin panel, build a page for each ClientBusiness / Bot where I can:
	1.	Enter one or more URLs to scrape (their website, FAQ page, services page, etc.).
	2.	Your backend:
	•	Fetches and parses the HTML.
	•	Extracts readable text.
	•	Cleans it.
	•	Stores it into KnowledgeSource associated with the bot.
	3.	Add a simple status system:
	•	PENDING, SUCCESS, FAILED for each scrape job.
	4.	Show the admin a preview of scraped content:
	•	Title of page.
	•	Short excerpt.
	•	Last updated time.

This scraped content will be used in the AI engine as retrieval context.
Do not build an open “scraper for any random user”.
This is a tool only inside the admin panel.

⸻

PHASE 4 — Admin Bot Builder (This is MY Command Center)

Goal: A clean, powerful admin-only interface where I set up each bot.

In an /admin area (protected for "AGENCY_ADMIN"):

For each ClientBusiness:
	1.	Bot Overview Page
	•	Show basic bot info (name, status, linked business).
	•	Button to open “Edit Bot Settings”.
	•	Summary of recent conversations + leads + bookings.
	2.	Bot Settings Editor
I should be able to configure:
	•	Bot name and avatar.
	•	Bot tone/personality (short description).
	•	System instructions (full “who you are” prompt).
	•	Welcome message.
	•	Fallback message (“Sorry, I’m not sure…”).
	•	Business hours, timezone.
	•	Calendar link for bookings.
	•	Services list.
	•	FAQs: add/edit/delete BotFAQ rows (question + answer).
	•	Which knowledge sources are active.
You can use a tabbed interface:
	•	“General”
	•	“Personality & Instructions”
	•	“FAQs”
	•	“Knowledge”
	•	“Behavior”
	3.	Simple Automations (Admin-Only)
	•	A small section where I can set:
	•	If user mentions X keyword → send Y message or suggest booking link.
	•	This should be FORM-based, not a huge visual workflow builder.
	4.	Preview / Test Panel
	•	On the right side, show a mini chat window.
	•	When I change settings, I can test messages and see how the bot will respond using current config + knowledge.

No client ever sees this screen.
This is MY control room.

⸻

PHASE 5 — AI Engine (Reliable, Simple, Context-Aware)

Goal: Build a solid AI engine that uses:
	•	System instructions from the bot.
	•	FAQs.
	•	Scraped knowledge.
	•	Conversation history.
	•	Business info (hours, services, etc.).

Implementation:
	1.	Create a backend service/module, e.g. src/server/services/aiEngine.ts, with something like:
	•	generateBotReply({ botId, conversationId, userMessage, recentMessages })
	2.	Inside that function:
	•	Load bot record, FAQs, and any active KnowledgeSource data.
	•	Build a context string (or retrieval structure) including:
	•	Business name, services, contact info.
	•	FAQs.
	•	Scraped content (summarized if needed).
	•	Build an OpenAI prompt with:
	•	System message: bot instructions + key rules (don’t hallucinate, ask for clarification when unsure, etc.).
	•	Conversation history (recent messages).
	•	User message.
	•	Additional “tool” style instructions if needed (for bookings, etc.).
	3.	Requirements:
	•	The AI must NEVER expose raw internal instructions.
	•	The AI should:
	•	Answer using business-specific info whenever possible.
	•	Avoid guessing if info is missing.
	•	Suggest calling, texting, or booking when appropriate.
	4.	Add safety:
	•	Try/catch around OpenAI calls.
	•	Friendly fallback message if OpenAI fails.

⸻

PHASE 6 — Widget & Deployment

Goal: Build a beautiful, lightweight chat widget that any client can embed on their site.
	1.	Create a front-end widget component that:
	•	Shows a chat bubble on bottom-right (or configurable left/right).
	•	Opens a chat window when clicked.
	•	Shows bot avatar, name, and welcome text.
	•	Allows user to:
	•	Type messages.
	•	See streaming or standard bot responses.
	•	Persists conversation in your backend (Conversation + Message).
	2.	Embed Script:
	•	Provide an embed.js script in public that clients can drop on their site.
	•	Example snippet:

<script src="https://your-domain.com/embed.js" data-bot-id="BOT_ID"></script>


	•	The script should:
	•	Inject the chat widget into their page.
	•	Pass botId into your system.

	3.	Design:
	•	Use Tailwind + shadcn-style components for the chat window.
	•	Focus on clean, modern, mobile-friendly UI, not overcomplicated theming.
	•	Widget settings (colors, position, welcome text) come from the bot settings in the admin panel.
	4.	Make sure:
	•	Widget works on desktop & mobile.
	•	No console errors.
	•	It doesn’t break host page layout.

⸻

PHASE 7 — Simple Client Dashboard

Goal: A very simple, clean dashboard for business owners (CLIENT_USER) to log in and view data for THEIR business only.

When a CLIENT_USER logs in, they should see:
	1.	Home / Overview
	•	Overview cards:
	•	Conversations (last 7/30 days)
	•	New leads
	•	Bookings
	•	Tiny chart for conversation volume over time.
	2.	Conversations Page
	•	List of conversations:
	•	Date/time
	•	Short preview of user’s first message
	•	Status (open/resolved)
	•	When a conversation is clicked:
	•	Show full chat transcript.
	•	Show AI-generated summary at top:
	•	“This user asked about X, is likely interested in Y, and should be followed up by Z.”
	•	Show linked lead (if any) + booking (if any).
	3.	Leads Page
	•	Table of leads:
	•	Name, email, phone
	•	Source (widget, campaign, etc.)
	•	Status (dropdown: NEW, CONTACTED, BOOKED, LOST)
	•	Created date
	•	Ability to update status + add a short note.
	4.	Bookings Page
	•	List of upcoming + past bookings:
	•	Customer name
	•	Service type
	•	Date/time
	•	Status (scheduled/completed/cancelled)
	•	If you integrate with a calendar link, show it.
	5.	Settings Page (Very simple)
	•	Toggle bot ON/OFF.
	•	Widget color (dropdown / color picker).
	•	Notification options (email for new leads/conversations).
	•	Show the embed snippet with their botId so they can give it to their web dev.

Important:
	•	Clients cannot edit bot instructions, FAQs, knowledge sources, or AI behavior.
	•	They only view data and very basic settings.

⸻

PHASE 8 — Polish & Test (Make It Bulletproof)

Goal: Turn this into a clean, stable, production-ready MVP.
	1.	Code Cleanup
	•	Remove unused imports.
	•	Remove dead code.
	•	Fix all TS errors.
	•	Normalize naming.
	•	Respect workspace/client scoping everywhere.
	2.	UI/UX Polish
	•	Ensure all layouts look good on desktop and mobile.
	•	Fix spacing, typography, overflow, scroll issues.
	•	Add loading states and empty states:
	•	“No conversations yet.”
	•	“No leads yet.”
	•	Add success + error toasts for key actions.
	3.	Testing
	•	Run through full flow:
	•	Admin creates a business + bot.
	•	Admin scrapes a website and adds FAQs.
	•	Admin tests bot via preview.
	•	Client logs in.
	•	Widget installed on a test page.
	•	End user chats with bot.
	•	Lead captured.
	•	Booking created (or at least simulated).
	•	Client sees conversation, lead, and booking in dashboard.
	•	Fix any bug you find automatically.
	4.	Final Report
	•	When done, output:
	•	Summary of what you implemented.
	•	Any remaining rough edges.
	•	Suggestions for next improvements (but do not implement scope-creep features unless they support the core flow above).

⸻

GLOBAL RULES
	•	Keep scope tight: admin builds bots, clients view results.
	•	No huge “build-your-own AI app” system.
	•	No over-engineered workflow engines.
	•	Everything must be clean, stable, understandable.
	•	Prefer quality and reliability over feature count.

⸻

Start from PHASE 1 and work through PHASE 8 in order.
Ask clarifying questions only if absolutely needed; otherwise make the best reasonable assumptions.

If you want after this, I can give you a matching QA-only prompt and a “stress test the whole system” prompt, but this master prompt is the one that should get Replit building exactly what you want.
