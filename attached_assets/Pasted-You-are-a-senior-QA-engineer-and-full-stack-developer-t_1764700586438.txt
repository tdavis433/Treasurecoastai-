You are a senior QA engineer and full-stack developer testing the Treasure Coast AI web app.

Your job:
Run a FULL end-to-end test of the “create a bot → configure it in admin → view it in client dashboard → stress test chats → verify booking/purchase link + analytics” flow.

Assume:
- The app is running on http://localhost:3000 (or whatever dev URL is configured).
- There is a working landing page, admin panel, and client dashboard already wired up.
- If any route or button text is slightly different from what I describe, ADAPT to the real UI. Don’t stop – find the closest match and continue.

────────────────────────────────
1. LANDING PAGE FLOW – VISITOR → “GET A BOT”
────────────────────────────────
1. Start a browser session against the running app (http://localhost:3000 by default).
2. Load the landing page.
3. Verify basic things render with no errors in the console (no uncaught exceptions, no 500s, no missing chunks).

4. On the landing page, locate the main CTA to start the process, something like:
   - “Get Your AI Assistant”
   - “Get a Bot Built for You”
   - “Start Free Demo”
   If the exact text is different, pick the main CTA that clearly starts the bot-creation flow.

5. Click that CTA and confirm it routes to a “create bot / get started” page or form. 
   - If routing fails or the button does nothing, log that as a BUG with details (URL, console error, stack trace if any).

────────────────────────────────
2. BOT CREATION FORM – ENTER RICH BUSINESS INFO
────────────────────────────────
On the “create a bot” / onboarding form:

1. Fill out all fields with realistic data for a fake business. Use something like:

   Business name: “Neon Harbor Fitness”
   Industry/Niche: “Gym / Fitness Studio”
   Location: “Treasure Coast, FL”
   Business description: “24/7 key-card gym focused on strength training and small group coaching.”
   Primary goals for the bot:
     - Answer FAQs about memberships, hours, and classes
     - Capture leads (name, email, phone)
     - Book intro sessions
   FAQ samples:
     - “What are your hours?”
     - “Do you offer day passes?”
     - “How much is a membership?”
     - “Can I bring a guest?”
   Brand tone: “Friendly, confident, modern, a bit high-energy.”
   Booking / purchase link (VERY IMPORTANT): 
     - Use something like: https://example.com/booking/neon-harbor-fitness
     - This represents the client’s real booking / checkout page. 

2. If the form allows:
   - Upload or paste a knowledge base / extra info.
   - Select bot type / category if there is a dropdown (support bot, sales bot, booking bot, etc).
   - Set business hours.
   - Set default greeting message.
   - Set lead capture fields (name, email, phone).

3. Submit the form.

4. Confirm:
   - A new bot record is created in the database.
   - The app routes to either:
     - a “success / thank you” page, or
     - directly to an admin or “setup in progress” screen.

5. If there are any validation issues, broken flows, or confusing error messages, log them as BUGS with:
   - Exact field
   - Error text
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior

────────────────────────────────
3. ADMIN PANEL – CONFIGURE THE NEW BOT PERFECTLY
────────────────────────────────
Now switch into the ADMIN / SUPER-ADMIN experience.

1. Open the admin panel route (for example: /super-admin, /admin, /dashboard/admin – find the correct one by inspecting routes / code).
2. Log in using any seeded admin credentials or environment variables. If credentials are not obvious, inspect the codebase (.env.example, seeding scripts, README) to find them.

3. In the admin UI:
   - Locate the client or bot that was just created for “Neon Harbor Fitness”.
   - Open its detailed settings / configuration page.

4. Verify you can see ALL the onboarding info you submitted:
   - Business name, niche, description
   - Bot goals
   - FAQ seeds
   - Brand tone
   - Booking / purchase link URL

5. Using the admin panel, polish the bot config so it’s “production-ready”:
   - Make sure FAQ/knowledge fields are filled cleanly.
   - Confirm lead capture is enabled (and what fields are required).
   - Ensure that at least one flow/intent includes a call-to-action that uses the booking/purchase link.
     Example: when user says “book a session”, the bot should respond with something that includes the URL and/or a button linking to it.

6. Save the bot configuration and confirm:
   - No validation or network errors.
   - Bot status is set to ACTIVE (not paused/demo).
   - Any usage limits, temperature, or model settings are reasonable.

────────────────────────────────
4. CLIENT DASHBOARD – LOG IN AS THE CLIENT & VERIFY
────────────────────────────────
Now simulate the actual client logging into their dashboard.

1. Identify how client credentials are created from the onboarding flow:
   - Is a client user created automatically with email + temp password?
   - Is there a magic link?
   - Is there a default test client user you can log in as?

2. Using either:
   - The newly created client credentials, or
   - A seeded “client” user for the same Neon Harbor Fitness tenant,
   log into the CLIENT DASHBOARD (not admin).

3. In the client dashboard, verify:
   - The new bot appears in their list of bots.
   - Bot status is “Active” (or similar).
   - Client can see:
     - Conversations / Inbox (even if empty at first)
     - Lead list / captured contacts
     - Analytics / basic stats (if implemented)
     - Bot settings (read-only or editable depending on design)

4. Confirm the booking/purchase URL is visible wherever it should be in the client dashboard (settings panel, bot overview, etc.). If it’s missing, log as a BUG.

────────────────────────────────
5. STRESS TEST THE BOT – CHAT + EDGE CASES
────────────────────────────────
Now simulate real users hammering the bot.

1. Open the live chat widget / bot test area:
   - Could be an embedded widget preview,
   - A dedicated /demo/:botId route,
   - Or a “Test Chat” modal inside admin/client dashboard.

2. Run a structured test chat session:
   - Ask at least 30–50 different messages, including:
     - FAQs we configured:
       - “What are your hours?”
       - “How much is a membership?”
       - “Do you have day passes?”
     - Off-topic questions:
       - “Tell me a joke.”
       - “What’s the weather?”
     - Edge cases:
       - Very short messages: “???” “hi” “yo”
       - Long rambling questions.
       - Typos: “membrship”, “gim”, “treasur coast”.
     - Booking intent:
       - “I want to book a session.”
       - “How do I sign up?”
       - “Where do I pay?”

3. Confirm the bot:
   - Responds quickly with no 500 errors.
   - Stays on brand (friendly, confident, modern).
   - Handles unknown questions gracefully.
   - When user expresses booking intent, the bot:
     - Either responds with the booking URL we configured,
     - Or presents a button / link that leads to https://example.com/booking/neon-harbor-fitness (or whatever we set).
   - Does NOT leak system prompts, API keys, stack traces, or raw error messages.

4. While stress testing, watch the dev tools / terminal logs for:
   - API timeouts
   - OpenAI errors
   - rate limit issues
   - unhandled promise rejections

Log any serious issues as BUGS.

────────────────────────────────
6. CLIENT DASHBOARD – VERIFY LOGGING & ANALYTICS
────────────────────────────────
After the stress test chat session:

1. Go back to the CLIENT DASHBOARD for the same bot.

2. Verify:
   - All conversations you had with the bot are visible in:
     - Conversation history / Inbox
     - Or logging / transcripts section
   - Message content matches what you actually sent and received (no missing, duplicated, or misordered messages).

3. If lead capture is enabled:
   - Confirm any lead forms triggered by the chat are recorded in the Leads section.
   - Check that data is correct (name, email, phone).

4. If analytics exist:
   - Confirm the metrics update (conversation counts, users, etc.).
   - If there is any obvious mismatch (e.g., you had 30 messages but analytics say 0), log as BUG.

────────────────────────────────
7. BOOKING / PURCHASE LINK – END-TO-END CHECK
────────────────────────────────
Now thoroughly verify the BOOKING / PURCHASE link behavior.

1. Confirm that:
   - The booking/purchase URL you set in the admin panel for this bot:
     - is saved correctly in the database / config.
     - is accessible in the client dashboard.

2. In the chat:
   - Trigger the bot to send the booking link again via booking intent messages.
   - Click the link/button from the bot’s response.

3. Ensure:
   - The browser navigates to the exact URL configured (no wrong domain, no broken routing).
   - No mixed-content or security errors.
   - The link works both in:
     - The test/demo chat
     - Any embedded client widget view (if available).

If anything about the link flow fails or is not configurable per bot, log that as a BUG and propose how to fix it (e.g., “Add a bookingUrl field to the Bot model and wire it into the booking intent response.”)

────────────────────────────────
8. OUTPUT – DETAILED QA REPORT + FIXES
────────────────────────────────
At the end, produce a structured report in Markdown with:

1. **Overview**
   - Which URLs you used
   - Which user roles you tested (visitor, admin, client)

2. **Passed Checks**
   - List all flows that worked correctly (landing → create bot, admin config, client dashboard, chat, booking link, etc.).

3. **Bugs Found**
   For each bug:
   - Title
   - Severity (Critical / Major / Minor)
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Relevant logs / stack traces
   - File/route references if known

4. **Improvements / Suggestions**
   - UX improvements
   - Missing feedback, unclear copy, edge cases

5. **Follow-Up Tasks**
   - Concrete dev tasks for fixing each bug or polishing the experience.

If you find bugs that you can safely fix inside this Replit project, go ahead and:
   - Implement the fix
   - Re-run the relevant part of the test
   - Update the report noting that the issue is FIXED and referencing the commit or files changed.

Your goal: behave like an expert QA + engineer making sure the “Landing → Get a Bot → Admin Config → Client Dashboard → Chat Stress Test → Booking Link → Analytics” flow is rock solid and production-ready.
