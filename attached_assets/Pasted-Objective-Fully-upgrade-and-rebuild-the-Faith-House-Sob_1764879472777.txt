Objective:

Fully upgrade and rebuild the Faith House Sober Living demo AI Assistant into a complete, polished, extremely powerful industry-specific assistant designed to impress the first prospect (the landlord) and demonstrate the true potential of Treasure Coast AI.

This update MUST follow these requirements:

⸻

🔥 1. Replace “Book Appointment” with the Correct Sober Living Options

Sober living homes DO NOT “book appointments.”
Replace this with the correct industry-standard actions:

New Required Core Actions:
	1.	Book a Tour
	2.	Schedule a Phone Call
	3.	Request More Information
	4.	Check Room Availability
	5.	Submit Pre-Screening Questions

These must be prominent in the assistant’s workflow.

⸻

🔥 2. Add Full Sober Living–Specific Intake Workflow

Anyone contacting a sober living home usually needs structured guidance.
The assistant must gather:

Essential Pre-Screening Questions:
	•	What substance(s) are you seeking help maintaining sobriety from?
	•	Are you currently sober? (If yes, how long? If no, when was your last use?)
	•	Do you need detox first?
	•	Do you have insurance or a funding source?
	•	What is your age?
	•	Are you needing male or female housing?
	•	Do you have any co-occurring mental health diagnoses we should be aware of?
	•	Are you currently on any medications?
	•	Do you require medication management?
	•	Do you have any legal restrictions (probation/parole)?
	•	When are you hoping to move in?
	•	Do you prefer a shared or private room (if available)?

All responses must be logged into the lead system for review.

⸻

🔥 3. Add “Instant Information Center” for Fast Answers

Add a full FAQ-style instant help menu:

Information Categories the bot must answer clearly:
	•	Program rules
	•	What to bring
	•	Curfew times
	•	Cost & fees
	•	Insurance options
	•	What services are included
	•	House expectations
	•	Work / employment expectations
	•	Required meetings (AA/NA etc.)
	•	Move-in process steps
	•	Touring hours
	•	Who is eligible / not eligible

⸻

🔥 4. Add a High-End Introduction Flow

The assistant must introduce itself in a warm, professional tone:

Example Intro Standard:
“Hi there! Welcome to Faith House Sober Living. I’m here to help you check availability, schedule a tour, set up a phone call, or answer any questions about our program. Everything is confidential — just let me know how I can support you.”

It MUST feel:
	•	Supportive
	•	Safe
	•	Professional
	•	Clear
	•	Not robotic

⸻

🔥 5. Add Strong Lead Capture Logic

After answering questions or starting a conversation, the bot should smoothly capture:

Lead Info:
	•	Full name
	•	Phone number
	•	Email (optional but suggested)
	•	Preferred contact method
	•	Urgency (Today, 1–3 days, 1 week, unsure)

If someone is clearly high intent, the assistant should prioritize:

“Would you like me to schedule a tour for you?”
or
“Would you like me to set up a call with our intake coordinator?”

⸻

🔥 6. Add Realistic Follow-Up Logic

If someone leaves mid-conversation, the bot should guide them:

“Would you like me to save your place and send you the next steps by text or email?”

⸻

🔥 7. Add “Cost Information” Handling

Sober living homes often don’t list exact prices publicly, so the bot should:
	•	Explain pricing ranges
	•	Explain what is included
	•	Offer to schedule a call for full breakdown

⸻

🔥 8. Add “Insurance + Funding” Support Logic

Many prospects ask:
	•	Does insurance cover this?
	•	What types of insurance?
	•	Is self-pay available?
	•	Do you offer scholarships?

The bot must handle these gracefully.

⸻

🔥 9. Add Engagement-Boosting Features

These help with conversion:

Ask:
	•	“Would you like photos of the home?”
	•	“Would you like to see room options?”
	•	“Would you like me to text you the tour address?”
	•	“Do you want me to check upcoming move-in openings?”

Offer:
	•	Instant availability check
	•	Tour confirmation messages
	•	Phone call reminders

⸻

🔥 10. Add Admin-Side Controls

Everything added must be compatible with your new AI-Driven Customization Layer (industry templates, toggles, natural-language editable).

⸻

🔥 11. DO NOT BREAK EXISTING PLATFORM

The upgrade is additive only.
Preserve:
	•	existing architecture
	•	existing client dashboard
	•	existing chat engine
	•	existing super-admin panel

Only extending the Faith House demo workflow.

⸻

🧨 Final requirement

The Faith House assistant should feel so polished, so supportive, and so professional that the landlord immediately says:

“Damn… I want this on all my properties.”

This demo must be your flagship.
