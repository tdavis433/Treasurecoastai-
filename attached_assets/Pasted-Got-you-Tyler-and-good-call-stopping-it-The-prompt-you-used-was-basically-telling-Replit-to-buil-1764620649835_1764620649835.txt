Got you, Tyler — and good call stopping it.
The prompt you used was basically telling Replit to build an entire Intercom-sized SaaS from scratch. That’s why it started generating a huge “self-service full program builder” — it followed the prompt too literally and went enterprise mode.

Let’s bring this back to EXACTLY what you want:

⸻

⭐ YOUR REAL GOAL (Simplified & Accurate)

You want a platform where:

1. YOU can easily build custom AI assistants for clients

— You build the logic
— You control the bot personality
— You design the conversation flows
— You tailor the bot to each business

2. The CLIENT gets a simple dashboard

The client only sees:
	•	📅 Appointments
	•	👤 New leads
	•	💬 Conversations
	•	✉️ Contact submissions
	•	📊 Simple analytics

3. You don’t want to build Intercom, Drift, Zendesk, etc.

You want:
	•	A clean, modern, simple AI assistant builder
	•	A clean client dashboard
	•	Lead/Chat/Booking management
	•	Basic automations
	•	Basic widget settings
	•	Clean UI
	•	Reliable AI behavior
	•	Clear, non-bloated structure

4. You don’t want the bot builder to build “full programs”

You want it to:
	•	Let YOU build AI assistants
	•	Let YOU customize everything
	•	Let clients JUST see results
	•	No crazy dev tools, no big workflows, no SaaS monster

5. You want the Replit prompt to focus ONLY on this.

⭐ THE REAL PRODUCT YOU WANT LOOKS LIKE THIS

ADMIN SIDE (YOU only)
	•	Build bots for your clients
	•	Set the bot personality
	•	Add business info
	•	Add FAQs
	•	Add booking links
	•	Add follow-up messages
	•	Customize widget
	•	Turn on lead capture
	•	Connect calendar
	•	Connect notifications
	•	Test and preview everything

This is like a Botpress Lite but 10x easier.

⸻

CLIENT SIDE (the business owner)

They log in and ONLY see:

1. Recent chats

AT THE MOST basic level:
	•	Chat viewer
	•	Lead details
	•	Mark as contacted

2. Leads
	•	List of captured leads
	•	Name/email/phone
	•	What they asked
	•	Bot summary of intent
	•	Click-to-call

3. Bookings / Appointments
	•	Appointment list
	•	Customer info
	•	Linked chat
	•	Calendar sync

4. Settings (very basic)
	•	Toggle bot on/off
	•	Widget color
	•	Business hours
	•	Notification settings

That’s it.
Clean. Simple. Powerful.
ZERO advanced workflow madness.
