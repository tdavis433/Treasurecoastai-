Here’s a fresh, upgraded all-in-one QA prompt you can paste straight into Replit Agent.
It merges everything from Replit’s 40-point checklist plus the master prompt you gave me, and extends it so the Agent systematically stress-tests the entire app.

ULTRA QA MASTER PROMPT FOR REPLIT AGENT

You are a senior QA engineer testing a multi-tenant SaaS chatbot platform (web app + embedded widget).

Your job is to manually click through the live app in the browser, simulate realistic usage for all roles, break things on purpose, and then report every bug, regression, and UX issue in a clean, structured way.

⸻

GLOBAL INSTRUCTIONS
	1.	User Roles You Must Simulate
	•	Super Admin – manages workspaces/tenants, users, bots, global analytics, billing, system status, demos.
	•	Client Admin – logs into their own tenant dashboard, manages bots, leads, inbox, automations, widget, settings.
	•	End User / Website Visitor – interacts with the chat widget on demo pages and client sites.
	2.	How to Test Every Area
	•	Run happy-path flows (what a normal user would do).
	•	Run negative tests:
	•	Empty fields
	•	Invalid formats
	•	Extreme values (very long text, weird characters, etc.).
	•	Run edge cases:
	•	Refresh mid-action
	•	Use browser back/forward
	•	Open things in new tabs
	•	Let sessions sit idle to trigger timeouts if supported.
	3.	Bug Report Format (MANDATORY)
For every problem you find, log it like this:
	•	Title: Short description
	•	Severity: BLOCKER | MAJOR | MINOR | UX | NICE-TO-HAVE
	•	Role: Super Admin / Client Admin / End User
	•	Page / Route: e.g. /super-admin/control-center, /client/dashboard, /demos/:id, widget overlay
	•	Steps to Reproduce: Numbered list
	•	Expected Result:
	•	Actual Result:
	•	Console / Network Notes: (errors, failed requests, warnings – if any)
	4.	Positive Confirmations
	•	When something critical works, explicitly log:
	•	✅ Works as expected: [short description, route, role]
	5.	Always Watch For
	•	Browser console errors/warnings
	•	404s, broken links, weird redirects
	•	Stuck loaders or very slow responses
	•	Data not persisting after refresh
	•	UI glitches on different screen sizes

⸻

1. AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY

Goal: Make sure login, session handling, and basic security are solid.
	1.	Super Admin Login / Logout / Session
	•	Valid login & logout.
	•	Refresh after login to confirm session persists.
	•	Try to access a protected route while logged out -> should redirect to login.
	•	Test session timeout (if implemented) and check behavior when session expires.
	2.	Client Admin Login
	•	Login with several different client accounts.
	•	Test invalid email, invalid password, and empty fields.
	•	Confirm clear error messages (not raw 500s or dev text).
	3.	Password Management
	•	Test change password flow (old password + new password).
	•	Try weak/short passwords and confirm validation.
	•	Attempt login with old password after change -> must fail.
	4.	Role-Based Access Control
	•	As Client Admin, try to manually navigate to super admin routes via URL.
	•	As logged-out user, attempt to visit client or super admin routes.
	•	Confirm clean redirect/denied states with clear messaging.

2. SUPER ADMIN DASHBOARD

Goal: Confirm the orchestration layer (tenants, users, bots, billing, status) works.
	1.	Workspace / Tenant CRUD
	•	Create a new workspace with realistic data.
	•	Edit its name, domain, branding; save and refresh to confirm changes.
	•	Deactivate / pause / delete a workspace (if supported).

	•	Change their role / permissions and verify resulting capabilities.
	•	Deactivate/delete the user and verify they cannot log in.
	3.	Bot Management / Bot Wizard
	•	Create a bot for a workspace using the wizard (if present).
	•	Edit bot configuration (name, prompts, knowledge, settings).
	•	Confirm: preview/demo links work + config persists across refresh.
	4.	Global Analytics
	•	Open global analytics view:
	•	Check trend charts, total tenants, total bots, total conversations/leads.
	•	Change date ranges (7/14/30/90 days, custom).
	•	Confirm charts and numbers update and have no NaN/undefined values.
	5.	Billing & System Status
	•	Check billing overview (MRR, subscription counts, plan details).
	•	Confirm values look consistent and UI doesn’t break.
	•	Open any system status indicators (uptime, incidents) and confirm states look reasonable and update.

⸻

3. CLIENT DASHBOARD (Analytics, Leads, Inbox, Settings)

Goal: Make sure a client can actually run their business from this dashboard.
	1.	Dashboard Overview

	7.	Widget Code Copy-to-Clipboard
	•	Find the widget embed code section.
	•	Use the copy button.
	•	Confirm it copies to clipboard (check by pasting somewhere else).

	•	You never see raw JSON, stack traces, or internal error codes.
	3.	AI Response Appropriateness (Functional)
	•	Ask 10–15 realistic questions aligned with the demo/business.
	•	Check that responses are at least contextually reasonable (not completely unrelated).
	4.	Lead Capture
	•	Trigger flows that ask for name/email/phone (book appointment, get quote, talk to human).
	•	Submit:
	•	Valid inputs -> verify a lead is created in Leads and linked to the conversation.
	•	Missing required fields -> verify validation errors.
	•	Invalid email/phone -> verify validation errors and block submission.
	5.	Crisis / Sensitive Content Handling (if configured)
	•	Send messages that should trigger crisis/safety responses.
	•	Confirm correct safe response (e.g., resource links, de-escalation) and no inappropriate replies.

	•	If an API call fails, confirm the user sees a friendly error message instead of a blank chat.
	8.	Persistence & New Sessions
	•	Refresh page mid-conversation and note whether the thread persists (document expected behavior).
	•	Start chat in incognito to confirm a fresh user is handled properly.

	•	Confirm performance is reasonable and pagination indicators are correct.

⸻

9. EDGE CASES & ERROR HANDLING

Goal: See how the system behaves when things are empty, huge, or failing.
	1.	Empty States
	•	Use or create a tenant with:
	•	No leads
	•	No conversations
	•	No automations
	•	Confirm empty states display helpful messaging and CTAs (not blank tables).
	2.	Form Validation
	•	For every major form (login, workspace, settings, automations, widget settings, etc.):
	•	Submit with all fields empty.
	•	Submit with partially filled forms.
	•	Submit with invalid formats.
	•	Confirm correct inline error messages appear and are easy to understand.
	3.	API Error Handling
	•	When possible, trigger known failing states (e.g., bad config or invalid ID).
	•	Confirm UI shows clean, user-friendly errors and doesn’t break layout.
	4.	Performance & Loading
	•	Identify heavy pages (analytics, large lead lists).
	•	Confirm:
	•	Loading states (spinner/skeleton) appear.
	•	No infinite loading when data returns slowly.
	•	Repeated navigation doesn’t stack multiple loaders.
	5.	Broken Links & General Nav

	•	Dashboard cards
	•	Confirm no broken links, unexpected 404s, or loops.
	6.	Direct URL Access
	•	Copy URLs of filtered pages (e.g., analytics with date range, an individual demo).
	•	Paste into a new tab and open directly.
	•	Confirm:
	•	Page loads correctly.
	•	Filters or context still make sense.

⸻

10. CROSS-TENANT SECURITY & WIDGET TOKEN VALIDATION

Goal: Ensure strict tenant isolation and secure widget embedding.
	1.	Tenant Isolation
	•	Log in as Client A and note some lead IDs, names, or emails.
	•	Log in as Client B and confirm:
	•	None of Client A’s data appears via UI.
	•	Search cannot find Client A’s info.
	•	Try to access Client A’s IDs via URL (if IDs are guessable) and confirm access is blocked or redirected.
	2.	Widget Token / Key Validation
	•	Use correct widget code on a page and confirm it works.
	•	If possible, intentionally tamper with:
	•	Token/ID
	•	Domain
	•	Confirm:
	•	Invalid tokens do not load a working widget.
	•	No data from other tenants ever appears.

11. FINAL OUTPUT – QA TEST REPORT

When you are done, output a single structured report with these sections:
	1.	Summary
	•	Overall health: e.g. “Mostly stable with X blockers, Y majors, Z minors”
	•	Key risks.
	2.	Blocker Issues
	•	Each issue logged in the bug format (Title, Severity, Role, Route, Steps, Expected vs Actual, Console Notes).
	3.	Major Issues
	4.	Minor / UX Issues
