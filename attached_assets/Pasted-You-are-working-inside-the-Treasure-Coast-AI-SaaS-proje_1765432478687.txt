You are working inside the Treasure Coast AI SaaS project on Replit.

Context:
- Multiple QA and regression passes are now green.
- Recent changes fixed:
  - Admin inbox message display.
  - Duplicate workspace/email UX.
  - Appointment Types discoverability.
  - Booking data extraction (user messages first).
  - Widget embed preview on /dev/embed-test.
  - Production logging (no chat content or reset URLs).
  - Production configuration docs (env vars, SMTP, CORS, secrets, changing admin password).

From a product perspective, the app is ready for real small-business demos and onboarding. I do NOT want new features or new flows — only tiny security / production safety tweaks if they are missing.

Please:

1) Protect dev-only surfaces in production
   - Ensure `/dev/embed-test` and any other “dev / internal tooling” routes:
     - Require super_admin auth.
     - Are NOT accessible to unauthenticated users.
   - If they are already protected, do nothing.

2) Default admin credentials safety
   - Confirm there is a clear, simple path to change the default admin password (admin/admin123) in production.
   - If it’s not already enforced in code, add a **non-blocking** but visible warning for super_admin when:
     - The current admin username/password are still the defaults AND
     - `NODE_ENV === 'production'` (or equivalent).
   - The warning can be a small banner in the super-admin dashboard reminding to change the default password.
   - Do NOT block login; just warn.

3) Final pass: no sensitive data in logs
   - Double-check we are not logging:
     - Full chat transcripts.
     - Password reset tokens.
     - Raw access tokens or secrets.
   - In production:
     - It’s OK to log high-level errors, but not PII-heavy payloads.
   - Only adjust logging where clearly necessary.

4) Docs touch-up (replit.md)
   - In the Production Configuration / Security section, add a short note:
     - That `/dev/embed-test` is for internal use only and requires super_admin.
     - That default admin credentials must be changed before going live with real clients.
     - That no chat content is logged in production.

Important:
- Do NOT change any core product flows.
- Do NOT rename existing workspaces (Faith House, QA workspaces).
- Do NOT add onboarding wizards or new screens.

When you’re done, please summarize:
- Whether `/dev/embed-test` and similar routes were already protected or what you changed.
- Any logging adjustments you had to make.
- Any security-related notes you added to `replit.md`.
