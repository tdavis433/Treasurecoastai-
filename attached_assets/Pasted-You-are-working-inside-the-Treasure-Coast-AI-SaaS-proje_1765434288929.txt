You are working inside the Treasure Coast AI SaaS project on Replit.

Goal:
I want the platform to be **demo-perfect** for live sales calls. That means:

- A clean, curated set of demo workspaces/pages and assistants.
- All demo pages and assistants share a **uniform look & feel** (colors, theme, style).
- Demo assistants are jam-packed with realistic knowledge and ready to book tours/appointments/consults.
- Demo dashboards look “alive” with seeded leads, bookings, and conversations.
- There is a **safe, separate Faith House “live” demo** I can actually hand to my landlord.
- A **demo reset system** that lets me restore all demo workspaces back to their preloaded state after I play with them—WITHOUT touching real client accounts.

Please do NOT add any new “self-serve client onboarding wizard” or change core pricing/login flows. This work is ONLY about the demos, seed data, styling, reset tools, and cleanup.

1. DEMO ARCHITECTURE: /demos INDEX + FAITH HOUSE SEPARATION
────────────────────

1.1 /demos Index Page
- Create or update a `/demos` (or equivalent) index page that is linked from the main marketing/landing page’s “See what we can do” or demo CTA.
- This page should show **demo cards** for each main demo workspace you decide to keep. At minimum:
  - Faith House demo
  - At least one generic local business demo (e.g., “Paws & Suds Grooming” or another niche you think best shows the product).
- Each card should include:
  - Business name (e.g. “Faith House – Sober Living Facility”).
  - 1–2 line description of what the business is and what the AI helps with.
  - A clear “Open Demo” button that links to the specific demo route (e.g. `/demo/faith-house`).

1.2 Faith House Workspace Separation
- Confirm and enforce the following architecture:

  - Canonical Faith House workspace:
    - Workspace id/slug: e.g. `faith_house`.
    - Used by the client login `demo_faith_house` on the client dashboard.
    - This is the “live demo / real tenant” workspace I can eventually hand to my landlord.

  - Faith House **public demo** workspace:
    - Workspace id/slug: e.g. `faith_house_demo`.
    - Used exclusively by `/demo/faith-house`.
    - Safe to reset and reseed with demo data.

- Requirements:
  - `/demo/faith-house` must use `faith_house_demo`.
  - `demo_faith_house` client login must use the canonical `faith_house` workspace.
  - Do NOT merge these two workspaces or point them at the same database records.

────────────────────
2. UNIFIED LOOK & FEEL FOR ALL DEMO PAGES & WIDGETS
────────────────────

2.1 Page-Level Styling
- Use the `/demo/faith-house` page as the **design baseline**:
  - Same primary accent color (or controlled small palette).
  - Consistent typography scale (headlines, subheads, body text).
  - Consistent card styling (rounded corners, shadows, spacing).
  - Consistent layout for hero/sections where appropriate.
- Apply this styling to:
  - `/demos` index page (demo cards layout).
  - All individual demo pages (including `/demo/faith-house` and any others).

2.2 Widget Styling Across Demos
- For public demo widgets (those rendered on `/demo/*` pages):
  - Use a unified base style:
    - Same base font.
    - Consistent header structure (title + subtitle/description).
    - Consistent bubble style and padding.
  - You may vary **accent colors per business** (e.g., slightly different brand colors), but the overall widget style should feel coherent and “on-brand” with the app.

- Clean up any leftover mismatched themes or obvious placeholders on demo widgets.

────────────────────
3. KNOWLEDGE-PACKED DEMO ASSISTANTS
────────────────────

For each **main demo workspace** (at minimum, `faith_house_demo` and one generic local business demo):

3.1 Persona & System Prompt
- Create rich personas/system prompts such as:

  - For Faith House demo:
    - “You are a friendly, knowledgeable AI assistant for Faith House, a sober living facility. You help prospective residents and their families understand the program, rules, costs, availability, and how to schedule tours or intake calls. You are compassionate, clear, and non-judgmental.”

  - For a generic local demo (e.g., Paws & Suds Grooming):
    - “You are a friendly AI assistant for [Business Name], a local [business type]. You help visitors with pricing, availability, services, and booking appointments or consultations. Your tone is warm, helpful, and efficient.”

- Explicitly include in prompts:
  - Tone (friendly, calm, clear).
  - Target audience.
  - Main goals: drive toward booking appropriate appointment types (tours, calls, consults, services).

3.2 FAQs & Knowledge Base Content
- For each demo assistant:
  - Add **8–15 realistic FAQs** covering:
    - Who they help.
    - Services offered.
    - Pricing ranges/ballparks.
    - Onboarding/intake process.
    - Rules/policies (curfew, visitors, substance use for Faith House; policies for pets for grooming, etc.).
    - What to expect in a tour/consult/appointment.
    - Common objections (cost, scheduling, commitment) with reassuring answers.
  - Add **3–5 longer knowledge entries**, e.g.:
    - “About Faith House”
    - “Our Intake Process”
    - “Program Expectations and Rules”
    - “What to Expect on a Tour”
    - For other demos: “Our Services”, “First-Time Visit Guide”, etc.

- No placeholder text:
  - No “Lorem ipsum”.
  - No “TODO” or obviously unfinished fragments.

3.3 Hours & Appointment Types Configuration
- For each demo workspace:

  - Set realistic **business hours**:
    - e.g., Mon–Fri 9am–6pm; Sat 10am–4pm; closed Sunday.

  - Configure **appointment types** in the Booking & Links / Appointment Types section:
    - For Faith House demo:
      - “Facility Tour”
      - “Phone Consultation”
      - “Intake Screening Call”
    - For other demos:
      - Types aligned to their services (e.g. “Full Grooming Appointment”, “Bath & Brush”, “New Client Consultation”, etc.).

- Ensure the assistant can reference and book these appointment types via the existing automations/config.

3.4 Automations
- For each demo workspace:
  - Confirm default automations (e.g. “New Lead – Tag & Status”, “New Booking – Notification”) are enabled.
  - Configure tags and statuses so that:
    - Leads get useful tags like “inbound”, “demo-lead”, “tour-request”.
    - Bookings get appropriate statuses: Pending, Confirmed, Completed, No-Show.

────────────────────
4. DEMO DATA SEEDING – SCRIPT & SEEDED CONTENT
────────────────────

4.1 demoSeed.ts for All Main Demo Workspaces
- Create or extend a **demoSeed.ts** (or similar) script that can:

  - Reset and reseed **all main demo workspaces**, not just Faith House, for example:
    - `faith_house_demo`
    - Any other demo workspaces you decide to keep (e.g. grooming/medspa/etc.).
  - For each demo workspace, it should:
    - Wipe only that workspace’s leads, bookings, and demo conversations.
    - Re-insert the predefined demo data described below (leads, bookings, conversations, statuses, tags).

- Very important:
  - The script must operate only on an **explicit, hard-coded list of demo workspace IDs** (e.g. `const DEMO_WORKSPACE_IDS = ['faith_house_demo', 'paws_suds_demo', ...]`).
  - It must **never** touch:
    - The canonical `faith_house` workspace.
    - Any other non-demo client workspaces.
    - Any newly created customer workspaces that are not in the explicit demo list.

4.2 Faith House Demo Seeding
- For `faith_house_demo`, seed:

  - Leads:
    - 10–30 realistic leads.
    - Varied statuses: New, Contacted, Tour Scheduled, Completed, No Show.
    - Tags such as: “tour-request”, “phone-inquiry”, “family-member”, “high-intent”.
    - Realistic names and emails (no “QA Test Visitor”).

  - Bookings:
    - Several upcoming and recent bookings:
      - Types: “Facility Tour”, “Phone Consultation”, “Intake Screening Call”.
      - Statuses: Pending, Confirmed, Completed, No-Show.
      - Dates spread across the last few weeks and the next few weeks.

  - Conversations:
    - Seed transcripts where:
      - Visitors ask about beds, rules, costs, length of stay, etc.
      - The assistant responds using the new knowledge.
      - Some conversations end in bookings, some are informational only.

- Ensure the **Overview dashboard** for `faith_house_demo` looks “live”:
  - Non-zero leads, bookings, and conversations.
  - Charts have plausible trends.

4.3 Other Demo Workspaces Seeding
- For any other main demo workspace(s):

  - Seed leads, bookings, conversations analogous to their business type:
    - e.g., for grooming:
      - Leads asking about grooming packages.
      - Bookings for “Full Grooming” or “Bath & Brush”.
      - Conversations about shedding, nervous pets, pricing, etc.

- Ensure each demo dashboard:
  - Has non-zero metrics.
  - Looks like an active account, not an empty shell.

────────────────────
5. DEMO RESET BUTTON (SUPER-ADMIN ONLY, DEMOS ONLY)
────────────────────

I want a **Reset Demos** button that restores all main demo workspaces back to their preloaded, seeded state **after I’ve played with them in a demo**.

Requirements:

5.1 Reset Behavior
- The reset should:
  - Call a backend endpoint that invokes the `demoSeed.ts` logic (or equivalent server-side function).
  - Wipe and reseed data for **only the demo workspaces** in the explicit list of demo IDs.
  - Restore:
    - Leads
    - Bookings
    - Conversations
    - Any demo-specific statuses/tags
  - It MUST NOT:
    - Touch canonical `faith_house`.
    - Touch any real client workspaces.
    - Touch any new workspaces created via the New Client wizard.

5.2 UI Placement & Access Control
- Add a **Reset Demos** control that is:

  - Visible only to **super_admin** users (not to client users).
  - Ideally placed either:
    - On the super-admin dashboard in a clearly labeled “Demo Tools” or “Internal Tools” section, OR
    - On a dedicated internal page (e.g. `/dev/demo-tools`), but still behind super_admin auth.

- UX requirements:
  - Use clear labeling, e.g.:
    - “Reset Demo Data”
    - Tooltip or help text: “Resets all demo workspaces (Faith House Demo, etc.) back to their preloaded leads, bookings, and conversations. Does NOT affect real client accounts.”
  - Add a simple confirmation step (modal or confirm dialog) to prevent accidental clicks.

5.3 Safety Guarantees
- The reset logic must:
  - Use the same hard-coded list of **demo workspace IDs** as the `demoSeed.ts` script.
  - Never operate on workspaces outside that list, even if a malicious actor tried to hit the endpoint with a custom ID.

- Consider:
  - Guarding the endpoint with:
    - super_admin auth.
    - Optionally `NODE_ENV` check so it’s only usable in dev/demo environments.
  - But if you expect to demo from a “prod-like” environment, keep it available but strictly super_admin-only.

5.4 New Client / Workspace Behavior
- When a **new client or workspace is created** via the New Client wizard:
  - It should NOT be affected by the demo reset.
  - It should come up with whatever the normal onboarding provides today (auto-created workspace + bot + default automations), i.e., “factory defaults” for a real customer.

- The demo reset must never:
  - Wipe or alter any data in newly created non-demo workspaces.
  - Modify their leads/bookings/conversations.

────────────────────
6. CLEANUP OF QA WORKSPACES, ASSISTANTS, AND TEST USERS
────────────────────

I want the environment to feel focused on **real demos + real clients**, not QA clutter.

Please:

- Remove or otherwise hide from normal UI:

  - Workspaces that clearly belong to old QA runs:
    - Names starting with `QA ` or similar (“QA Regression Workspace”, “QA Onboarding Workspace”, etc.).
  - Assistants whose names start with `QA ` or contain obvious test labels.
  - Test client users with emails like:
    - `qa.*@example.com`
    - `qa.*+*@example.com`.

- DO NOT remove:
  - Canonical `faith_house` workspace.
  - Faith House demo workspace.
  - Any real production tenant data (if present).

If you choose not to hard-delete some QA entities, ensure they:
- Are not visible in super-admin UI by default.
- Are clearly marked as “internal only” and excluded from all demo routes.

────────────────────
7. FAITH HOUSE “LANDLORD-READY” WORKSPACE
────────────────────

I need the canonical `faith_house` workspace (used by `demo_faith_house` login) to be something I can confidently show my landlord as “this is what your account will look like”, without it being obviously stuffed full of fake demo noise.

Please:

- Canonical `faith_house` workspace:
  - Ensure persona, FAQs, knowledge base, hours, appointment types are **realistic and coherent** for Faith House.
  - Seed data may be present but:
    - Use moderate, believable volumes.
    - Avoid obviously over-the-top charts or fake data patterns.

- Faith House demo (`faith_house_demo`):
  - This one can be more heavily seeded, polished, and “showy” for `/demo/faith-house`.

- Confirm mapping:
  - `demo_faith_house` login → canonical `faith_house` workspace.
  - `/demo/faith-house` route → `faith_house_demo` workspace.

────────────────────
8. FINAL VERIFICATION & DOCUMENTATION
────────────────────

After implementing everything above:

1) Manually verify:
   - `/demos` index:
     - Demo cards show.
     - Each card opens its demo page.
   - Each demo page:
     - Unified styling.
     - Correct assistant widget loads.
     - Assistant answers detailed business-specific questions.
     - Assistant can book appropriate appointment types.

2) For each demo workspace:
   - Overview:
     - Non-zero, plausible metrics.
   - Leads:
     - Seeded leads match the business type.
   - Bookings:
     - Seeded bookings have correct appointment types & statuses.
   - Inbox:
     - Seeded conversations look like real humans, not test noise.

3) For Reset:
   - As super_admin:
     - Click the Reset Demos button.
     - Confirm demo workspaces are wiped + reseeded to the expected preloaded state (leads, bookings, conversations).
     - Confirm canonical `faith_house` and any new non-demo workspaces are untouched.

4) For Faith House:
   - Login as `demo_faith_house`:
     - Confirm the canonical `faith_house` workspace is landlord-ready.
   - Visit `/demo/faith-house`:
     - Confirm it uses `faith_house_demo` and is heavily demo-optimized.

5) Update `replit.md`:
   - Add a “Demo Configuration & Reset” section explaining:
     - Which workspaces are considered main demos (names/ids).
     - Which routes map to which demo workspaces.
     - That `demoSeed.ts` and the Reset Demos button only affect those demo workspaces.
     - That new client workspaces are never touched by the demo reset.

Please keep changes focused on demos, styling, seed data, and the safe reset mechanism. Do NOT add new client-facing onboarding wizards or change core billing/login behavior.
