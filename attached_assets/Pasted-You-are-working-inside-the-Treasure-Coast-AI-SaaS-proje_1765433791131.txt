You are working inside the Treasure Coast AI SaaS project on Replit.

Goal:
I want the platform to be **demo-perfect** for live sales calls. That means:

- A clean, curated set of demo workspaces/pages and assistants.
- All demo pages and assistants share a **uniform look & feel** (colors, theme, style).
- Demo assistants are jam-packed with realistic knowledge and ready to book tours/appointments/consults.
- Demo dashboards look “alive” with seeded leads, bookings, and conversations.
- There is a **safe, separate Faith House “live” demo** I can actually hand to my landlord after showing him the system.

Please do NOT add any new “self-serve client onboarding wizard” or change the core pricing/login flows. This work is ONLY about the demos, seed data, styling, and cleanup.

────────────────────
1. DEMO ARCHITECTURE – FAITH HOUSE & MAIN DEMO PAGE
────────────────────

Current known structure (from earlier work):
- There is a canonical Faith House workspace (e.g. `faith_house`) used by the `demo_faith_house` client login.
- There is a separate Faith House demo workspace (e.g. `faith_house_demo`) used by `/demo/faith-house`.

I want the following architecture:

1) **Main demo index page** (the “See what we can do” / lead-gen demo page)
   - This is currently something like `/demos` (or whatever route is already being used from the main landing page).
   - Add the **Faith House demo** ( `/demo/faith-house` ) to this main demo page, alongside any other demo cards.
   - Each demo card should:
     - Show the business name.
     - Show a short 1–2 line description of what the business is (e.g. “Faith House – sober living facility”).
     - Have a clear button like “Open Demo” that links to that demo page.

2) **Faith House demo vs Faith House live**
   - Keep **two separate workspaces** for Faith House:
     - `faith_house_demo` → used ONLY for `/demo/faith-house`. This can be reset and reseeded as needed.
     - `faith_house` (or similar) → canonical “live demo” workspace used by the `demo_faith_house` client login.
   - Requirements:
     - Do NOT merge demo and live workspaces.
     - Do NOT delete the canonical `faith_house` workspace or the `demo_faith_house` client login.
     - `/demo/faith-house` should be hooked to the **demo** workspace, not the canonical one.
   - The Faith House **demo** page (`/demo/faith-house`) should match the same look & feel as the other demo pages (see sections below).

────────────────────
2. UNIFORM LOOK & FEEL FOR ALL DEMO PAGES & ASSISTANTS
────────────────────

I want all demo experiences to feel visually consistent, like one polished product:

- The `/demo/faith-house` page is the reference design:
  - Use its color palette, typography, and layout as the **design baseline** for:
    - The main `/demos` index (cards, layout).
    - Any other individual demo pages (if they exist).

Specific requirements:

1) **Visual theming**
   - All demo pages (including `/demo/faith-house`) should share:
     - The same primary accent color.
     - Consistent spacing, card styles, and typography scale.
   - If individual businesses have unique branding inside the widget (e.g. widget color), that’s fine—but the *page chrome* should feel uniform.

2) **Demo assistant widget styling**
   - For every demo assistant used on public demo pages:
     - Use a consistent, polished default widget style:
       - Same base font.
       - Similar chat bubble style.
       - Header layout (title, subtitle, avatar).
     - Each assistant can have:
       - Business-specific name (e.g. “Faith House AI Assistant”, “Paws & Suds AI Assistant”).
       - Business-appropriate color variant (e.g., different but complementary color shades), but keep the overall widget style consistent.

Make sure:
- Any previous inconsistent or placeholder theming for demo assistants is updated to this unified look.

────────────────────
3. DEMO ASSISTANTS – KNOWLEDGE BASE & CONFIG “JAM-PACKED”
────────────────────

I want the main demo assistants to feel **deep and realistic** for their specific demo business.

For every primary demo workspace (including `faith_house_demo` and any other demo business you keep):

1) **Persona & system prompt**
   - Set a rich, business-specific persona like:
     - “You are a friendly, knowledgeable AI assistant for [Business Name], a [business type]. You help visitors with [key goals: pricing, availability, booking tours/appointments, answering common questions].”
   - Include:
     - Tone (friendly, clear, reassuring).
     - Target audience (e.g. sober living residents, pet parents, etc.).
     - Main objectives (convert to booked tours/appointments, qualify leads, etc.).

2) **Knowledge Base / FAQs**
   - For each demo assistant, fill the Knowledge/FAQ sections with **realistic, high-density content** about that fictional business:
     - Who they help.
     - Services offered.
     - Pricing ranges or examples.
     - Location & neighborhood.
     - Rules/policies (e.g., curfew, visitors, pets).
     - Common objections/concerns and good responses.
   - At minimum:
     - 8–15 well-written FAQs per demo.
     - 3–5 longer-form knowledge base entries (about, program details, process, etc.).
   - Make sure:
     - The knowledge is consistent with the demo page copy.
     - There are no placeholder texts like “Lorem ipsum” or “TODO”.

3) **Hours & appointment types**
   - For each demo business:
     - Configure hours (e.g., Mon–Fri 9am–6pm, Sat 10am–4pm).
     - Configure appointment types in the Booking & Links / Appointment Types section to match what that business would realistically offer, e.g.:
       - For Faith House:
         - “Facility Tour”
         - “Phone Consultation”
         - “Intake Screening Call”
       - For another demo (e.g., pet grooming):
         - “Full Grooming Appointment”
         - “Bath & Brush”
         - “New Client Consultation”
     - Ensure the AI assistant is able to suggest/use these appointment types in conversation.

4) **Automations**
   - Confirm default automations for:
     - “New Lead – Tag & Status”
     - “New Booking – Notification” (or equivalent)
   - Are **enabled** and configured for each demo workspace so that:
     - Leads get tags like “inbound”, “demo-visitor”, etc.
     - Bookings get appropriate default statuses.

────────────────────
4. DEMO DASHBOARDS – RESET & SEED LIKE IT’S LIVE
────────────────────

I want each main demo workspace’s dashboards to look like they’re actively being used.

For each primary demo workspace (including `faith_house_demo` and any others you keep):

1) **Reset current demo data**
   - In the dev/demo database:
     - Clear out old demo junk that is confusing, inconsistent, or from prior QA runs.
   - Specifically:
     - Remove old leads/bookings/conversations that don’t match the new personas/knowledge.
     - Remove QA test visitors (e.g. names starting with “QA ”, emails like `qa.*@example.com`) from demo workspaces.

2) **Seed realistic demo data**
   - Seed each demo workspace with:
     - Leads:
       - 10–30 demo leads with realistic names, emails, phones, statuses (New, Contacted, Tour Scheduled, etc.).
       - Appropriate tags (e.g. “tour-request”, “call-request”, “high-intent”).
     - Bookings:
       - Several recent/future bookings:
         - Mix of tours, phone calls, consults—whatever fits the business.
         - Different statuses (Pending, Confirmed, Completed, No-Show).
     - Conversations:
       - Seed transcripts where:
         - Visitors ask typical questions.
         - The assistant answers using the new knowledge base.
         - Some end in a booking, some just info-only.
   - Make sure:
     - Dates look plausible (recent days/weeks; some upcoming appointments).
     - Data aligns with the demo’s hours and appointment types.

3) **Metrics**
   - Ensure that the Overview dashboard for each demo workspace shows:
     - Non-zero counts for:
       - Leads
       - Bookings
       - Conversations
     - Charts that have some shape (not all empty).

Implementation detail:
- It’s fine to do this via a demo seed script (e.g. `demoSeed.ts`) and/or one-off seeding for the dev/demo environment.
- Just don’t dirty the canonical Faith House live workspace with fake demo-only data; keep that workspace’s data realistic and separated as needed.

────────────────────
5. CLEAN UP OLD QA / NON-DEMO WORKSPACES & ASSISTANTS
────────────────────

I want the environment to be clean and focused on **real demos + real clients**, not past QA clutter.

Please:

1) Remove QA-labeled/demo-only junk
   - In the seed scripts and the current dev/demo database, remove:
     - Workspaces starting with `QA ` (e.g., “QA Regression Workspace”, “QA Onboarding Workspace”, etc.).
     - Assistants starting with `QA ` or “QA …”.
     - Client users whose emails look like `qa.*@example.com` or `qa.*+*@example.com`.
   - DO NOT delete:
     - The canonical Faith House workspace (`faith_house`).
     - The Faith House demo workspace (`faith_house_demo`).
     - Any new, non-QA workspaces I create going forward.

2) Keep only:
   - The main demo workspaces/pages.
   - Their demo assistants.
   - The Faith House canonical workspace for the `demo_faith_house` client.
   - Any actual production tenants (if present) untouched.

If you need to preserve QA examples for future internal use, keep them as code comments or in documentation, not live in the visible app.

────────────────────
6. FAITH HOUSE “LIVE DEMO” COPY FOR LANDLORD
────────────────────

I need a Faith House workspace that I can actually give to my landlord as a **live example** after showing off the demos.

Current structure:
- `faith_house` (canonical) used by the `demo_faith_house` client login.
- `faith_house_demo` used by `/demo/faith-house` for resettable public demo.

Requirements:

1) Confirm & polish canonical Faith House workspace (`faith_house`)
   - Ensure:
     - Persona, FAQs, knowledge, hours, appointment types are all **realistic** for Faith House.
     - Its dashboard shows sane but not over-the-top data (less “salesy-seed” than pure demos).
   - This is the workspace I will eventually connect to real Faith House operations, so keep it:
     - Clean.
     - Less obviously “fake demo data”.

2) Demo Faith House page (`/demo/faith-house`)
   - This one can be more “showy”:
     - Heavier seed data.
     - Very polished knowledge & FAQs.
   - Make sure the page:
     - Clearly explains this is a demo.
     - Matches the unified demo styling.

3) Do NOT link `/demo/faith-house` directly to the canonical `faith_house` workspace.
   - Keep the architecture:
     - `/demo/faith-house` → `faith_house_demo` (resettable).
     - `demo_faith_house` login → `faith_house` (canonical “live demo” tenant).

────────────────────
7. FINAL VERIFICATION & NOTES
────────────────────

After implementing all of the above:

1) Please run a manual check for each main demo:
   - Open `/demos`.
   - Open each demo page (including `/demo/faith-house`).
   - Confirm:
     - Styling is consistent.
     - The assistant widget appears with correct color/position/greeting.
     - The assistant can answer detailed questions about the business.
     - It can schedule an appropriate appointment type via chat.

2) For each demo workspace:
   - Check:
     - Overview dashboard → non-zero, plausible metrics.
     - Leads → seeded leads look consistent with the business.
     - Bookings → seeded bookings have correct appointment types and statuses.
     - Inbox → seeded conversations look realistic.

3) For Faith House:
   - Confirm:
     - `demo_faith_house` client login still works and views the canonical `faith_house` workspace.
     - `/demo/faith-house` still works and is wired to `faith_house_demo`.

If any of these steps require assumptions, please document them in `replit.md` under a “Demo Configuration” section so I know exactly:

- Which workspaces are considered “main demos”.
- Which workspaces are safe to reset.
- Which workspace is the canonical Faith House “live demo” I can hand to my landlord.

Again: do NOT build any client-facing onboarding wizard. I will always be the one configuring and managing these demos from the super-admin side.
