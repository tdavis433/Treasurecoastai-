You are an elite full-stack engineer and QA lead.

You are working on the Treasure Coast AI platform running in this Replit project.

FOCUS ONLY ON THIS FOR NOW:
  • Faith House demo chatbot → leads → bookings → conversations.

CONSTRAINTS:
  • Do NOT redesign the UI.
  • Do NOT delete the Faith House workspace or assistant.
  • Make minimal, correct backend + integration fixes so the flow is RELIABLE.

WHAT SHOULD WORK (ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA):

1) From `/demo/faith-house`:

   - Start a conversation as a visitor.
   - Ask realistic questions:
       • “Do you have any beds available?”
       • “What are the rules about curfew or visitors?”
       • “How much is the weekly cost?”
   - Provide contact info when asked:
       Name:  "QA Demo Visitor 1"
       Phone: "555-111-2222"
       Email: "qa.visitor1@example.com"
   - Then say:
       • “I’d like to book a tour tomorrow at 3 PM.”
       • “I’d like to schedule a phone call on Saturday at 10 AM.”

   AFTER THIS CONVERSATION:

   A. In the FAITH HOUSE CLIENT dashboard (login: demo_faith_house / demo123):
      - Leads page:
          • There is a new lead for "QA Demo Visitor 1" with correct phone + email.
      - Bookings page:
          • There are TWO bookings:
              – One clearly labeled as a Tour with correct date/time.
              – One clearly labeled as a Phone Call with correct date/time.
      - Conversations page:
          • The conversation transcript is present and readable.

   B. In the SUPER ADMIN workspace for Faith House (login: admin / admin123):
      - Go to Clients → Faith House workspace.
      - Leads tab:
          • The same lead record appears.
      - Bookings tab:
          • The same two bookings appear.

   C. During normal flows:
      - No visible "An error occurred while processing your message" toast.
      - If any OpenAI or backend error happens, show a friendly message to the user
        and log the full technical details on the server ONLY (not in the UI).

YOUR TASK:

1. Run the app in this Replit project (npm install / npm run dev or whatever is configured).
2. Find the code path for the Faith House assistant conversation handling:
   - Chat completion handler.
   - Lead creation.
   - Booking creation.
   - Conversation persistence.
3. Fix the bugs so the acceptance criteria above are satisfied.
   - Make sure workspace/assistant IDs are correctly used.
   - Make sure lead + booking writes are not failing silently.
   - Make sure the faith-house demo is configured correctly to use this pipeline.
4. Add reasonable error handling so the red error toast is NOT shown for valid flows.
5. When you are done, describe what you changed and re-run the end-to-end flow yourself
   to confirm that:
   - Lead is created.
   - Tour booking is created.
   - Phone call booking is created.
   - All visible in BOTH client and admin Faith House views.
