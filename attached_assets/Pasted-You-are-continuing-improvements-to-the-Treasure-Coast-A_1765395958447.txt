You are continuing improvements to the Treasure Coast AI SaaS in this Replit project.

Auth, Faith House parity, user/workspace management, and assistants should now be improved.

────────────────────
GOAL OF THIS BLOCK
────────────────────
1. Fix and verify **“View as Client”** flows.
2. Confirm **multi-tenant isolation** in code.
3. Improve **responsiveness/layout** for key flows so the demo feels polished.

────────────────────
PART A – “VIEW AS CLIENT”
────────────────────
1. In the super admin “Clients/Workspaces” area:
   - For Faith House:
     - Ensure “View as Client” opens the **canonical Faith House client dashboard** for `demo_faith_house`.
   - For at least one QA workspace:
     - Ensure “View as Client” opens that workspace’s client dashboard.

2. Make sure:
   - It never routes to the wrong tenant.
   - If a workspace has no client logins yet, handle gracefully (e.g., show a message or disable the button).

If some view-as-client buttons are inherently broken:
- Hide them until their underlying flows exist.

────────────────────
PART B – MULTI-TENANCY & DATA ISOLATION (CODE-LEVEL)
────────────────────
1. In server/backend code:
   - For all queries that return:
     - Leads
     - Bookings
     - Conversations
     - Assistants
   - Ensure they are always filtered by workspace/tenant id, derived from:
     - Authenticated user (client).
     - Selected workspace (admin context).

2. Admin dashboards:
   - Global metrics may aggregate across workspaces, but:
     - Per-workspace views must ONLY show that workspace’s data.

Add comments wherever you enforce workspace scoping so future changes don’t break this.

────────────────────
PART C – RESPONSIVENESS & LAYOUT
────────────────────
Focus on these key pages:

- Public landing `/`
- `/demo/faith-house`
- Faith House client dashboard:
  - Overview
  - Leads
  - Bookings
  - Conversations
- Admin:
  - Main dashboard
  - Clients list
  - One QA workspace overview
  - Assistants list
  - Assistant drawer

At least ensure they are usable at:
- ~1440px width (desktop)
- ~1280px (small laptop)
- ~768px (tablet portrait)
- ~375–414px (mobile)

For each:

- Make sure:
  - Critical buttons/CTAs (login, New Client, New Bot, View as Client, Save) are not cut off.
  - Modals and drawers can be scrolled to reach actions.
  - Tables can scroll horizontally if needed without destroying layout.

Prefer simple, robust layout fixes (flexbox/grid, max-widths, overflow handling) over pixel-perfect design.

────────────────────
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR THIS BLOCK
────────────────────
- ✅ “View as Client” always opens the correct tenant dashboard or is disabled when not applicable.
- ✅ Backend queries for leads/bookings/conversations/assistants are all workspace-scoped.
- ✅ On a typical laptop and a phone-sized viewport, the core flows (log in, navigate dashboards, open New Client wizard, create login, open assistant drawer) are usable without permanent off-screen actions.

After this block, the app should be in **demo-ready shape** for a non-technical sober-living landlord.
