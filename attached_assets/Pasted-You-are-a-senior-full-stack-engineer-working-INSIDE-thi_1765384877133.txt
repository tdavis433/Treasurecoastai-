You are a senior full-stack engineer working INSIDE this Replit project.

This is a multi-tenant SaaS called **Treasure Coast AI** with:
- Super admin / agency panel (multi-workspace).
- Client dashboards per workspace.
- Assistants/bots per workspace.
- A Faith House demo workspace for sober-living demos.

The live app is at:
- https://treasure-coast-ai-platform--mlgrushskill.replit.app/

You do NOT need to call that URL. Instead, fix the code in this Replit so that when deployed, the app behaves correctly.

GOAL OF THIS BLOCK
────────────────────
1. Understand where everything lives in the codebase.
2. Fix **auth**, **login**, **logout**, and **route protection** for:
   - Super admin (agency owner).
   - Client/workspace users.

FOCUS ONLY ON THESE in this block. Do not touch assistants, leads, bookings yet.

────────────────────
STEP 1 – DISCOVER STRUCTURE
────────────────────
Find in this repo:
- Auth logic:
  - Login handlers (API routes, controllers).
  - Session/JWT handling.
  - Middleware/guards for protected routes.
- Routes/pages for:
  - Super admin (e.g. `/super-admin`, `/admin`).
  - Client dashboard (workspace-level).
  - Public demo routes (e.g. `/demo/faith-house`).
- Database/models for:
  - Users (admin vs client).
  - Workspaces/clients/tenants.
  - Relationship: which user belongs to which workspace.

Write light comments or docstrings while you discover, so future agents can see where things are.

STEP 2 – CLEAN LOGIN ROUTES
────────────────────
Current behavior from QA:
- `/login` is used for everything.
- `/client-login` was 404.
- We want clear separation of roles.

Implement:
- Either:
  - Single `/login` that:
    - Accepts username/password.
    - After auth, routes:
      - Admin → super admin dashboard.
      - Client → that client’s workspace dashboard.
- OR:
  - `/admin/login` → admin login.
  - `/client/login` → client/workspace login.

Key requirements:
- `admin` / `admin123` must log into **super admin** dashboard.
- `demo_faith_house` / `demo123` must log into **Faith House client** dashboard (NOT admin).

Fix the routing code and views accordingly.

────────────────────
STEP 3 – IMPLEMENT LOGOUT
────────────────────
Currently there is no visible logout.

Add:
- For admin dashboard:
  - A visible “Logout” or “Sign out” control in header or nav.
  - Clears auth (session/JWT/cookie).
  - Redirects to admin login screen (or neutral landing).

- For client dashboard:
  - A visible “Logout” / “Sign out”.
  - Clears client auth.
  - Redirects to client login or home landing.

Make sure both work in practice.

────────────────────
STEP 4 – PROTECT ROUTES
────────────────────
Ensure route guards are correct:

- Admin-only routes:
  - `/super-admin`, admin workspace management, etc.
  - Must require admin auth.
  - If not authenticated → redirect to admin login.

- Client-only routes:
  - Client dashboard, client leads/bookings/conversations.
  - Must require client auth.
  - If not authenticated → redirect to client login.

- If a client tries to hit `/super-admin`, they must be blocked or redirected.

No 404s or raw JSON errors for unauthorized access; use proper redirects or error pages.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR THIS BLOCK
────────────────────
- ✅ `admin` / `admin123` logs into super admin dashboard.
- ✅ `demo_faith_house` / `demo123` logs into Faith House client dashboard.
- ✅ Admin logout exists and works; after logout, `/super-admin` redirects to login.
- ✅ Client logout exists and works; after logout, client dashboard routes redirect to client login.
- ✅ Role-based protection: client cannot access admin routes; admin cannot “accidentally” load some wrong client page without proper routing.

Make code changes now so these criteria are satisfied. When you’re done, stop. We’ll handle Faith House data and assistants in later prompts.
