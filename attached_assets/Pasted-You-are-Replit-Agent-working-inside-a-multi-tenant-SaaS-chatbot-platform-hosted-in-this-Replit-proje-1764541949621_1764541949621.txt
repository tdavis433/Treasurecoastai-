You are Replit Agent working inside a multi-tenant SaaS chatbot platform hosted in this Replit project.

Your task: **Fix, complete, and fully implement the entire signup flow** for the platform.

Currently the “Sign Up” button or route does not work or lead anywhere. You must correct this and build a functional, secure, multi-tenant signup onboarding system.

Follow this plan exactly, without breaking existing login or admin functionality:

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## 1. OBJECTIVE

Implement a **fully working, secure, multi-tenant-aware signup flow** that:

- Allows a new customer to create their own **workspace (tenant)**.
- Creates the first **Client Admin user** for that workspace.
- Logs them in immediately after signup.
- Redirects them to their new **Client Dashboard**.
- Applies default workspace settings + default bot(s).
- Does NOT interfere with Super Admin or existing client workspaces.

Signup must be production-safe and visually clean.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. REQUIRED SIGNUP FLOW (END TO END)

### 2.1 SIGNUP UI
Fix or create the following:

- A working **Signup Page** (e.g. `/signup`).
- Form fields:
  - Full Name
  - Email
  - Password
  - Business / Workspace Name
  - (Optional) Phone Number
- Submit button that:
  - Disables during submission
  - Shows success/error states
  - Redirects accordingly

Ensure UI validates fields:
- Required fields
- Valid email format
- Password length (>= 8 chars)
- Workspace name not empty

### 2.2 SIGNUP ENDPOINT (BACKEND)
Create or fix an endpoint such as:

`POST /api/auth/signup`

This must:

1. Validate all fields.
2. Ensure email is not already used.
3. Create a new **workspace** row.
4. Create a **workspace_admin** user inside that new workspace.
5. Hash the password (bcrypt or existing hash method).
6. Create default workspace settings.
7. Create default bot(s) (use an existing template or create an empty bot).
8. Start an authenticated session or return a session token.
9. Return success, with workspace + user info.

### 2.3 SESSION / LOGIN AFTER SIGNUP
After successful signup:

- Automatically log the user in.
- Redirect: `/client/dashboard` or the correct workspace dashboard route.
- Ensure session cookie / JWT is created the same way login does.
- Ensure multi-tenant scoping works:
  - The new user should only see their own workspace.
  - They must NOT see other tenants’ data.

### 2.4 DATABASE CHANGES (ONLY IF NEEDED)
Only add what is missing:
- Ensure tables:
  - `workspaces`
  - `workspace_members`
  - `users`
  - `bots`
  - `sessions`
are compatible with signup creation.

If anything needed for signup logic is missing, add minimal required fields:
- workspace name
- owner flag or role
- initial settings defaults

Do NOT modify existing tables in a way that breaks super-admin or current client dashboards.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. FUNCTIONALITY TO FIX / IMPLEMENT

### 3.1 SIGNUP BUTTON DOES NOTHING
Fix:
- The signup button must link to `/signup`
- Or trigger the signup modal/router page
- Ensure routing works in both local dev and deployed environment

### 3.2 ERROR HANDLING
Add proper:
- Inline field errors
- Toast notifications
- API error messages (email already exists, weak password, etc.)
- Server-side validation (never rely only on frontend)

### 3.3 DEFAULT WORKSPACE INITIALIZATION
On signup, also create:
- Default workspace config (colors, widget settings)
- Default bot (or clone primary demo bot)
- Default automations if required
- Default analytics counters

All must be scoped to the new workspace ID.

### 3.4 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
Signup flow must:
- Hash passwords
- Prevent duplicate emails across the same workspace
- Not reveal if an email exists already (“This email is unavailable” instead of “This email is already registered in workspace X”)
- Not leak any workspace IDs in responses unless authenticated

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. TESTS TO RUN AFTER BUILDING

After implementation:

1. Load `/signup` – ensure UI loads with no errors.
2. Fill form with valid info → ensure success → redirected → logged in.
3. Fill with invalid email → fail with validation.
4. Fill with short password → fail with validation.
5. Try using an email that already exists → fail with safe error.
6. Confirm new workspace appears in super admin view.
7. Confirm user sees only THEIR workspace data.
8. Confirm default bot exists for that workspace.
9. Confirm chat widget for that new workspace works.
10. Confirm logging out & logging back in works properly.

Run through all screens on mobile and desktop.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED FROM YOU

After implementing everything:

- Output a **Signup Implementation Report** that includes:
  - Files created or modified
  - New routes or components
  - Database migrations (if any)
  - Summary of fixes
  - Instructions for testing
  - Any TODOs for later improvement

- Then confirm:
  - Signup is working
  - Login after signup is working
  - Multi-tenant isolation works
  - No breaking changes occurred

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Proceed now. Implement the full signup system end-to-end, fix the broken button, and ensure it is fully functional, secure, tenant-aware, and polished.
