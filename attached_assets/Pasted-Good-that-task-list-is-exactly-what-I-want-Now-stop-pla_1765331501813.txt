Good, that task list is exactly what I want.

Now stop planning and actually IMPLEMENT all of those tasks in the codebase, step by step:

1) For “Separate data by client ID” and “Pass client ID to all functions”:
   - Find all storage functions that fetch/update/delete leads and appointments by ID.
   - Update them so they ALWAYS take clientId/workspaceId as a parameter and enforce it in the WHERE clause.
   - Update all call sites to pass the correct clientId/workspaceId.

2) For “Check user belongs to workspace” and “Apply workspace checks to routes”:
   - Implement workspace membership checks using the existing workspace_memberships (or equivalent).
   - Apply this to ALL /api/client/:clientId and similar tenant routes so a user can’t hit another tenant’s data.

3) For “Restrict deletion to admins only”:
   - Add role-based checks (super_admin / workspace_admin) on destructive routes:
     - delete workspace, lead, appointment, bot, automations, etc.
   - Make sure normal client users cannot delete or globally reconfigure anything.

4) For “Remove hardcoded demo IDs”:
   - Search for hardcoded “faith_house” or demo IDs in routes/storage/shared logic.
   - Replace them with proper tenant-aware logic (demo seeding is fine, but no hardcoded IDs in live code).

5) For “Shorten long text with tooltips”:
   - In the client/admin dashboards, update tables for leads/conversations/bookings so long fields use truncation
     (e.g. Tailwind truncate + max width) and show full text on hover via title/tooltip.

6) For “Add loading states to lists”:
   - Wherever lists of leads/conversations/bookings/analytics are loaded, show a loading state (spinner or skeleton)
     while fetching, and a clear empty state when there’s no data.

7) Finally, “Build code and summarize changes”:
   - Run the TypeScript build and any tests that exist.
   - Fix any compile errors you introduced.
   - Then give me a concise summary of:
     - Files/functions changed for security/multi-tenancy,
     - Files/components changed for UI truncation/loading/empty states,
     - Any remaining TODOs you think are P1/P2, not P0.

Do NOT just restate the plan.
Actually modify the code, run the build, and then report back on what you changed.
