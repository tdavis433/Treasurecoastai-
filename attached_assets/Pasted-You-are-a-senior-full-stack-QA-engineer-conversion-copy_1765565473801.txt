Visual direction (use/check if relevant in UI):
Ocean Blue #0A5CFF, Aqua Teal #00C2B3, Deep Charcoal #1A1A1A, White #FFFFFF   [oai_citation:8‡treasure_coast_ai_full_assets_pack.pdf](file-service://file-J497XB5Uq9HEBkMWioydpv)

YOUR MISSION:
1) Discover ALL demo pages and ALL industries in this codebase.
2) Test EVERY aspect of the AI assistants on ALL demo pages.
3) Deep test BOOKING + APPOINTMENTS (and reservations) including edge cases.
4) Spot-check multiple other industries for consistency (layout, quality, assistant behavior, copy style).
5) Upgrade each demo page so it’s packed with real industry info + Treasure Coast AI benefits, so it can answer the questions a real customer would ask.
6) Double-check every demo webpage “looks good” (spacing, mobile, accessibility, broken components, missing content).
7) Deliver a clean QA + improvement report + implement fixes directly in the repo (including automated tests).

NON-NEGOTIABLE OUTCOMES:
- Every industry demo page must feel “real” and complete: services, FAQs, policies, pricing ranges (if appropriate), hours, service area, booking/rescheduling rules, contact, and clear CTAs.
- Every page must clearly explain Treasure Coast AI’s benefits and which automations apply to THAT industry (not generic fluff).
- Assistant must not hallucinate specifics. If info isn’t available, it should ask a smart follow-up question or offer to connect to a human.
- Booking/appointment flows must work flawlessly and handle timezone, confirmations, cancellations, reschedules, and failures.
- Output must include a prioritized list of issues, fixes applied, and any remaining TODOs.

PHASE A — INVENTORY + BASELINE
A1) Detect the tech stack (Next/React/Vite/etc), routing structure, and list all demo routes/pages.
A2) Produce a table: Industry | URL/Route | Has assistant? | Has booking? | Has contact CTA? | Content completeness score (0–10) | Notes.
A3) Identify shared components used across industries (layout, header, chatbot widget, booking widget).

PHASE B — UI/UX + CONTENT AUDIT (ALL PAGES)
For EACH industry demo page, verify:
B1) Visual quality:
- No broken layout, weird spacing, missing images, placeholder lorem ipsum, misaligned sections, poor mobile responsiveness.
- Basic a11y: headings hierarchy, button labels, contrast not terrible, focus states, keyboard nav, ARIA for modal/chat widget.
B2) Conversion essentials present:
- Clear hero statement for the industry + “Your Business, Upgraded.”
- “What we automate for (industry)” section (5–10 bullets specific to industry)
- “Why it matters” with measurable outcomes (faster response, fewer missed calls, more booked jobs, less admin time)
- Demo chatbot + clear “Try it” prompt
- Pricing guidance (use starter pricing ranges where appropriate) and what’s included
- Contact form or booking CTA
B3) Treasure Coast AI positioning present:
- Appointment/reservation, lead capture, customer service automation must be mentioned (industry-specific)   [oai_citation:9‡treasure_coast_ai_starter_pack.pdf](file-service://file-7GoaVFBhk7dMYHJicTcmk7)
- Mention future upgrades lightly: CRM + SMS follow-up, voice bot, dashboards (only if it fits page)   [oai_citation:10‡treasure_coast_ai_starter_pack.pdf](file-service://file-7GoaVFBhk7dMYHJicTcmk7)

PHASE C — AI ASSISTANT FUNCTIONAL TESTING (ALL PAGES)
For EACH industry assistant, run a scripted test pack and record pass/fail with transcript snippets.

C1) Core behaviors (must pass):
- Answers top FAQs for that industry (hours, pricing ranges if allowed, service list, service area, policies)
- Lead capture flow: asks for name + phone/email + job details; confirms; gives next step
- Escalation: “talk to a human” -> collects info + routes to contact method
- Handles unknowns safely: asks a clarifying question rather than inventing
- Tone matches brand: friendly, local, no fluff   [oai_citation:11‡treasure_coast_ai_master_prompt.pdf](file-service://file-YDNp2fQ9hnq4FwrMZwuFVb)

C2) Industry-specific scenarios (must exist & pass):
Create an industry scenario list automatically based on page/industry, such as:
- Restaurant: menu questions, allergens, reservations, wait times   [oai_citation:12‡treasure_coast_ai_starter_pack.pdf](file-service://file-7GoaVFBhk7dMYHJicTcmk7)
- Barber/Salon: book haircut/color, choose stylist, reschedule   [oai_citation:13‡treasure_coast_ai_starter_pack.pdf](file-service://file-7GoaVFBhk7dMYHJicTcmk7)
- Home services: quote request, service area, scheduling, emergency options   [oai_citation:14‡treasure_coast_ai_starter_pack.pdf](file-service://file-7GoaVFBhk7dMYHJicTcmk7)
- Retail: inventory check, returns, store hours, deals   [oai_citation:15‡treasure_coast_ai_starter_pack.pdf](file-service://file-7GoaVFBhk7dMYHJicTcmk7)
- Real estate: showings, listings, buying/renting questions   [oai_citation:16‡treasure_coast_ai_starter_pack.pdf](file-service://file-7GoaVFBhk7dMYHJicTcmk7)

C3) Safety & trust checks:
- No medical/legal/financial definitive advice.
- No guaranteed outcomes. Use realistic language.
- No collecting sensitive info beyond what’s needed.

PHASE D — BOOKING & APPOINTMENTS “DEEP TEST” (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
Where booking/reservations exist, test:
D1) Happy path:
- Select service -> pick date/time -> enter details -> confirm -> success message + confirmation delivery (if implemented)
D2) Reschedule/cancel:
- Cancel policy text shown; reschedule flow works; confirmations update
D3) Edge cases:
- Double-book protection
- Past time selection blocked
- Timezone correctness
- Closed hours blocked
- Missing required fields handled
- Backend/API failures show friendly error + retry + fallback to human
D4) Analytics/logging:
- Verify booking attempts are logged (if tracking exists); no PII leaks in console

PHASE E — CONSISTENCY SPOT CHECK (CROSS-INDUSTRY)
Pick at least 6 industries spanning:
- Booking-heavy (salon, dental/medical, fitness)
- Quote-heavy (HVAC/roofing/plumbing)
- Inventory/info-heavy (retail)
- High-intent leads (real estate/legal)
Compare:
- Layout consistency, CTA placement, assistant capability parity, content depth parity.
Create a “Consistency Issues” list with concrete fixes.

PHASE F — UPGRADE CONTENT (MAKE DEMOS “REAL”)
For EACH industry demo page, add/expand content so a real customer can get answers without calling.

Minimum content blocks per industry page:
1) Services offered (8–15 items)
2) Common questions (10–20 FAQs)
3) Booking / appointment details:
   - hours, duration estimates, what to bring/prepare, cancellation/reschedule policy
4) Pricing guidance:
   - ranges or “starting at” + what affects price (if appropriate)
5) Service area (if local/home service) or coverage
6) “What Treasure Coast AI automates for this industry” (8–12 bullets)
7) “Benefits” section with tangible results (time saved, fewer missed leads, faster response)
8) Clear CTA: “Try the demo bot” + “Get a free demo for your business”

Pricing references (use as general guidance across demos where appropriate):
- $297–$497/month subscription
- $300–$1,000 setup (after first clients)
- Advanced automation: $1,500–$3,500/month   [oai_citation:17‡treasure_coast_ai_starter_pack.pdf](file-service://file-7GoaVFBhk7dMYHJicTcmk7)

Also ensure pages match the site-wide landing expectations:
What We Do / Why It Matters / Demo / Pricing / Contact   [oai_citation:18‡treasure_coast_ai_full_assets_pack.pdf](file-service://file-J497XB5Uq9HEBkMWioydpv)

PHASE G — AUTOMATED TESTS + QUALITY GATES
Implement:
- Playwright (or equivalent) e2e tests that:
  - Visit every demo route
  - Validate key sections exist
  - Run chatbot smoke test (open widget, send 2–3 prompts, assert non-empty response)
  - Run booking smoke test where possible
- Lint/typecheck/build checks
- Basic Lighthouse/perf quick scan (optional)

DELIVERABLES (MUST CREATE IN-REPO FILES):
1) /reports/DEMO_QA_REPORT.md
   - Executive summary
   - Inventory table (all industries)
   - Booking deep test results
   - Assistant test results by industry (pass/fail + notes)
   - UI/UX findings with screenshots if possible
   - Consistency issues + fixes
2) /reports/CONTENT_GAPS_AND_FIXES.md
   - For each industry: what was missing + what you added
3) /tests/ (or relevant folder): e2e tests added
4) Commit changes with clear commit messages.

WORKING RULES:
- Don’t guess routes—discover them programmatically.
- Don’t add fluff copy. Every line should answer a customer question or sell a specific automation benefit.
- Keep the Treasure Coast AI tone: simple, local-friendly, confident, no jargon.   [oai_citation:19‡treasure_coast_ai_starter_pack.pdf](file-service://file-7GoaVFBhk7dMYHJicTcmk7)
- If any assistant response can’t be supported by on-page data, update the data source or change the assistant to ask a clarifying question.
- If you find duplicated logic across industries, refactor into shared components/config.

START NOW:
Run the inventory, then proceed phase-by-phase. Keep a running checklist in DEMO_QA_REPORT.md as you complete each phase.
