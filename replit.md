# Treasure Coast AI - Agency-First AI Chatbot Platform

## Overview
Treasure Coast AI is an **agency-first** AI assistant platform. The agency (admin) builds and manages custom AI chatbots FOR local businesses. Clients do NOT build bots — they only log in to view results (conversations, leads, bookings) through a simple dashboard.

**Core Mission:** "Give local businesses a 24/7 AI assistant that captures leads, books appointments, and answers questions – all managed for them by our agency, with a simple dashboard that shows results."

## Business Model (Agency → Client)

### Agency Owner (Admin)
- Logs into admin panel at `/super-admin`
- Creates and configures AI assistants for each client business:
  - Business info (services, pricing, hours, location)
  - AI personality & instructions
  - FAQs and common questions
  - Website scraping to learn the business
  - Automations (keywords → replies, booking suggestions)
- Generates widget embed code for client websites
- Manages all bot settings and updates

### Client Business (Customers)
- Gets a clean, simple client dashboard at `/client/dashboard`
- They can only VIEW, not build:
  - 💬 Conversations the bot has handled
  - 🧲 Leads captured (name, email, phone, what they wanted)
  - 📅 Bookings/appointments generated by the bot
  - 📊 Simple analytics (chats, leads, bookings over time)

- Easy for agency to set up bots for many different clients

❌ **Should NOT be:**
- A huge "no-code app builder"

- A complex Intercom/HubSpot clone with 1,000 features
