# Treasure Coast AI - Agency-First AI Chatbot Platform

## Overview
Treasure Coast AI is an **agency-first** AI assistant platform. The agency (admin) builds and manages custom AI chatbots FOR local businesses. Clients do NOT build bots — they only log in to view results (conversations, leads, bookings) through a simple dashboard.

**Core Mission:** "Give local businesses a 24/7 AI assistant that captures leads, books appointments, and answers questions – all managed for them by our agency, with a simple dashboard that shows results."

## Business Model (Agency → Client)

### Agency Owner (Admin)
- Logs into admin panel at `/super-admin`
- Creates and configures AI assistants for each client business:
  - Business info (services, pricing, hours, location)
  - AI personality & instructions
  - FAQs and common questions
  - Website scraping to learn the business
  - Automations (keywords → replies, booking suggestions)
- Generates widget embed code for client websites
- Manages all bot settings and updates

### Client Business (Customers)
- Gets a clean, simple client dashboard at `/client/dashboard`
- **Fully VIEW-ONLY** - They can see but not change:
  - Conversations the bot has handled
  - Leads captured (name, email, phone, what they wanted)
  - Bookings/appointments generated by the bot
  - Simple stats (total conversations, leads, bookings)
- Settings are display-only:
  - Assistant status (shows "Live" badge - always active)
  - Business information on file
  - Widget embed code (can copy)
- All changes require contacting the agency team

### End Users (Website Visitors)
- See chat widget on business website
- Chat with AI assistant
- Get answers, leave contact info, book appointments
- All interactions logged for client dashboard

## Design Philosophy
**Dark Luxury SaaS with Neon-Glass Accents** - Premium aesthetic inspired by Linear, Vercel, and Stripe:
- Deep blacks (#000000, #0A0A0F) with sophisticated depth
- Glassmorphism cards with backdrop blur and subtle borders
- Vibrant cyan primary (#00E5CC) with electric purple secondary (#A855F7)
- Neon glow effects and smooth micro-animations
- Premium feel that makes people say "damn I gotta try this"
